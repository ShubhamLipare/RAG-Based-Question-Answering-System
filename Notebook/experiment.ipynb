Maharashtra before Shivaji\\nShivaji Maharaj was a great man. \\nWe celebrate his birth anniversary with \\ngreat pomp and reverence. It is a happy day for you children. You sing songs and ‘powadas’ in his honour. You garland his picture and say ‘Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai’. \\nWho was this Shivaji Maharaj  ? What was \\nthe great work he did that we celebrate his birthday every year ?\\nThe time in which Shivaji Maharaj \\nlived was that of the medieval period. In those days, monarchy or the rule of kings prevailed everywhere. Many of the kings pursued their own pleasures and enjoyments instead of the welfare of their subjects. But even in those days, there were some kings who looked after the welfare of their subjects. The Moghul Emperor Akbar in the North and Emperor Krishnadevraya of Vijaynagar in the South are famous in history for their benevolent rule. Likewise, Shivaji Maharaj also commands great respect even today.\\nShivaji Maharaj established Swaraj \\nin Maharashtra. Swaraj means self-government, our own rule. For about four hundred years before Shivaji Maharaj, Maharashtra was not free. A large portion of it was under the rule of the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur. These two Sultans had divided Maharashtra among themselves. They were not liberal in their outlook. They oppressed the people over whom they ruled. They were also sworn enemies of each other. They constantly fought against each other with the result that the people suffered and were harassed. The people could not get enough to eat, nor could they celebrate their festivals or worship their gods openly and freely. They were not sure of safety even in their own homes. There was injustice everywhere. In Maharashtra, there were many Watandars like Deshmukhs and Deshpandes who owned Jagirs. They loved only their Jagirs and not their country. The constant fighting among them brought great misery to the people. There was misrule everywhere. People were tired of this oppression and were very unhappy.\\nShivaji Maharaj saw all this. He \\nundertook the noble task of establishing Swaraj in Maharashtra which would bring happiness to the people. He first brought to book the Watandars who fought among themselves. He then used them in his plan to establish Swaraj. He fought against the Powers that oppressed the people, and defeated them. He established ‘Hindavi Swaraj’ based on justice, fair play and equal treatment to people of all castes and religions. Shivaji Maharaj made no distinction between Hindus and Muslims. He honoured the saints of all religions. We draw inspiration from these noble deeds of Maharaj.\\nDuring a period of about three to four \\nhundred years before Shivaji Maharaj, many saints were born in Maharashtra. Their work helped Shivaji Maharaj in his successful effort of establishing Swaraj. We shall see in the next chapter, what these saints did.\\n2\\n1.Fill in the blanks choosing the correct\\noption.\\n(a) The time in which Shivaji Maharaj lived\\nwas that of the .......... period. \\n (ancient, medieval, modern)\\n(b) Shivaji Maharaj established Swaraj in \\n.......... .\\n (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh,  \\nUttar Pradesh)\\n2.Match the pairs.\\n   ‘A’              ‘B’\\n(a) Emperor of (1) Nizamshah\\n      Vijaynagar \\n(b) Sultan of (2) Adilshah\\n     Ahmadnagar  \\n(c) Sultan of Bijapur  (3) Krishnadevraya\\n(4) Emperor Akbar3.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) Name the kings who looked after the\\nwelfare of their subjects.\\n(b) What noble task did Shivaji Maharaj \\nundertake ?\\n(c) Who did Shivaji Maharaj fight against  ? \\n4.Find the odd-man-out.\\n(a) Swaraj, slavery, freedom\\n(b) People, subjects, king\\nActivity\\n(a) Celebrate Shivajayanti in your class.  \\n(b) Present historical songs and ‘Powadas’ in \\nthe cultural programmes held in your school. EXERCISES\\n\\n3 Shri Chakradhar Swami :  Shri \\nChakradhar Swami was originally a prince \\nfrom Gujarat. He became an ascetic, and came over to Maharashtra. He moved all over Maharashtra preaching equality. He did not believe in any discrimination based on gender or caste. So, several men and women became his followers. The sect he established is known as ‘Mahanubhav’ sect. Memorable incidents from his life have been compiled in a book titled ‘Leelacharitra’.\\n Sant Namdeo : Sant Namdeo was a \\ngreat devotee of Vitthal. He lived in the village Narasi. He composed numerous songs in praise of god, performed  The tradition of Sants that began in \\nMaharashtra with Shri Chakradhar, Sant Namdeo, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Chokha Mela was continued by Sants coming from various strata of society. In this group of Sants are included Sant Goroba, Sant Sawata, Sant Narhari, Sant Eknath, Sant Shaikh Mahammed, Sant Tukaram, Sant Niloba etc. Similarly,  Sant Janabai, Sant Soyarabai, Sant  Nirmalabai, Sant Muktabai, Sant Kanhopatra and Sant Bahinabai Shiurkar are also included.\\n They taught people various virtues \\nlike compassion, non-violence, charity, service, equality and brotherhood. No one is inferior, no one is superior. All are equal. Such was the sentiment that was created by Sants in the minds of people. Similarly, Samarth Ramdas also rendered his work in Maharashtra. \\n2. Work of the Saints\\nShri Chakradhar Swami\\n Sant Namdeo\\n4‘Keertans’ (songs and stories based on a \\nreligious theme) everywhere and brought about general awakening among the people. He moved all over Maharashtra to spread Bhagwat dharma and taught the people deep devotion to God. He instilled in them the desire to protect their religion. Sant Namdeo later travelled all over India spreading the message of \\nhumanity. He travelled to the Punjab and \\nspread the message of equality among \\nthe people there. He composed songs in \\nHindi. Even today, some of his verses are \\nincluded in ‘Guru Granth Sahib’, the holy \\nbook of the Sikhs. His songs are still sung all over Maharashtra with great love and devotion.\\nSant Dnyaneshwar :  Sant \\nDnyaneshwar’s family belonged to Apegaon. Nivruttinath and Sopandeo were his brothers. Muktabai was his sister. Bigoted men of the time used to look down upon these children because they were the offspring of a ‘Sanyasi’. It happened like this. Their father took ‘Sanyas’ and retired from worldly life. As a Sanyasi, he \\nleft home. But later on, obeying \\nthe order of his guru, he returned \\nhome and started living with his \\nwife. Their four children were born afterwards. The narrow-minded religious leaders did not think it right that a ‘Sanyasi’ should have children. People persecuted these children and banished them from their community.\\nOnce Dnyaneshwar went \\nround the town begging for alms. But no one would give him any alms. He had to listen to abusive language instead. Young \\nDnyaneshwar was deeply  pained by this \\nincident. He entered his hut and locked the door from inside to grieve over his lot. Muktabai came and knocked at the door. She said, “Open the door, Dnyaneshwar. How can we remain drowned in our own sorrow ? Who will then look to the \\nwelfare of the world  ?” These words of his \\nsister gave new hope to Dnyaneshwar. He \\nforgot his personal sorrow and started his \\nwork. Everywhere, the poor and backward \\npeople were being oppressed in the name \\nof the religion. Dnyaneshwar went among \\nthe people and taught them to have faith \\nin God. ‘Give equal treatment to all. Help those in trouble and allay their misery.’ This was the gist of his advice to the people. Dnyaneshwar’s words are heard \\nin every nook and corner of Maharashtra for the last seven hundred years.\\nIn those days, all religious teaching \\nwas confined to Sanskrit books. The language of ordinary people in everyday use was Marathi. Dnyaneshwar wrote his outstanding book ‘Dnyaneshwari’ in Marathi. He thus opened wide for his \\nSant Dnyaneshwar\\n5\\nSant Eknathpeople the doors of knowledge, where he \\npreached the ideal of brotherhood among all men. At a very early age, at Alandi near Pune, Dnyaneshwar took ‘Samadhi’, \\nthat is, put himself in a trance from which he never came out. Even today, on the eleventh day of Ashadh and Kartik, lakhs of pilgrims go to Alandi-Pandhari with devotion. even to the dumb animals. He exhorted the people to love all living beings and practised what he preached.\\nOne day he was going to the river \\nGodavari for a bath. It was noon and very hot. The sand bed along the riverside was very hot too. He heard the crying of a poor  \\nchild sitting on the hot sand. Eknath looked around and saw the child. He rushed to \\nhim and looked around for the child’s parents. He picked up the child in his arms, wiped his tears and reached him home.\\nIn this way, by his personal \\nexample, Eknath impressed the message of love and equality on the minds of the people. \\nSant Tukaram :\\n Two   great \\nsaints, Tukaram and Ramdas \\nlived in Shivaji’s time. Tukaram \\ncame from Dehu, near Pune. He owned a farm and also a \\ngrocery shop. His forefathers used to \\nlend money to the needy people. But \\nSant TukaramSant Eknath :  Sant Eknath carried on \\nthe work started by Sant Namdeo and Sant \\nDnyaneshwar. He lived in Paithan. He preached that the way to reach God was through devotion \\n- \\n‘Bhaktimarg’. He wrote numerous religious songs \\n- ‘Abhangs’, ‘Owees’ \\nand ‘Bharuds’. His advice to the people was not to accept any distinction of high and low. He made friends with the poor and the downtrodden and taught them devotion to God. His love extended \\n6Samarth Ramdas\\nTukaram drowned in the river Indrayani, \\nall the record of loan papers he had, thus \\ngiving relief to many. He would go to the neighbouring hill and sing songs in praise of God Vitthal. On the eleventh day, ‘ekadashi’ of the month of Ashadh and Kartik, he would go to Pandharpur. He wrote devotional songs \\n- ‘Abhangs’ \\nand performed ‘Keertans’. Thousands \\nflocked to listen to him. Shivaji Maharaj \\nalso attended his Keertans. Sant Tukaram \\npreached to the people about the virtues of \\npity, forgiveness and peace of mind. He \\nalso gave them the message of equality. \\n‘He alone is a saint, and God dwells with him who calls the weak and the downtrodden as his own’. He impressed this truth on the minds of the people. He made them think. People accepted him as a great religious leader and showered their praise on him. Even today, all over Maharashtra, we hear people proclaiming ‘Gyanba - Tukaram’ the names of the two great saints. Sant Dnyaneshwar is called ‘Gyanba’ also. Even today, ‘Tukaram \\nGatha’ is read in every household. \\nSamarth Ramdas : At the same time, \\nthe hills and valleys of Maharashtra were \\nfilled with the echoes of ‘Jai, Jai Raghuveer \\nSamarth’ (Glory be to the great Rama) an invocation constantly on the lips of the great saint Ramdas. Ramdas was born at Jamb on the banks of the Godavari in Marathwada. His birthday falls on Ram-Navami, the day on which the great hero, Rama, was born. Narayan was his real name but he preferred to call himself Ramdas, the servant of Rama. Through his great book ‘Dasbodh’ he taught \\nmen the ways of good life. Through his \\n‘Manache Shlok’ (stanzas addressed to the mind) he gave people lessons in good thoughts and good conduct. To popularise the worship of strength, he raised the temples of Hanuman, the god of strength. He exhorted people to be strong and told them of the power that resides in a united people. He taught them to organize themselves and fight against injustice. This gave courage to the people.\\nThe work of the saints brought about \\na great awakening among the people. Religion once again became a thing to be respected and a spirit of self-reliance was born. People regained their lost confidence. This great awakening among the people brought about by the saints helped Shivaji in his fight for Swaraj.\\nlll\\n71.Fill in the blanks :\\n(a) Sant Namdeo was a great devotee\\nof .......... .\\n(b) At a very early age, at .......... near Pune, \\nDnyaneshwar took ‘Samadhi’.\\n(c) Sant Tukaram drowned in the river \\n.........., all the record of loan papers he \\nhad. \\n(d) To popularise the worship of strength, \\nSamarth Ramdas raised the temples of .......... . \\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) What  discrimination  did  Shri \\nChakradhar    Swami    not    believe ?\\nEXERCISES\\n(b) What desire did Sant Namdeo instil \\namong the people ?\\n(c) What advice was rendered by Sant \\nEknath ?\\n(d) What message was propagated by \\nSamarth Ramdas ?\\n3.Give answers in three or four sentences.\\n(a) Why did Sant Dnyaneshwar lock\\nhimself   in   his   hut ?\\n(b) What message did Sant Tukaram give  ?\\nActivity\\nCollect the pictures of Sants other than those included in this lesson and below the pictures, write their thoughts.\\n\\n8\\n3. Maratha Sardars - The Famous House of the Bhonsales\\nPeriod of Unrest : As the saints \\npreached devotion to God, the brave \\nMaratha Sardars started a tradition of \\nbravery.\\nThis was a period of great unrest. \\nThe two Sultans, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar \\nwere constantly at war with each other. \\nThey made use of the armies of Maratha \\nSardars in these wars.\\nThe Brave Maratha Sardars : The \\nMarathas were both brave and tough. They were also fearless and loyal to \\ntheir masters. They were very proud of their achievements on the battlefield. The \\nbrave Maratha soldier with a spear in \\nhand and a sword at the side would ride \\nin his Sardar’s cavalry. All the Maratha \\nSardars had their own private armies. If such a Sardar went to the Sultan with his \\narmy, the Sultan gave him employment, \\nmade him a Sardar of his kingdom and \\nsometimes conferred a Jagir upon him. \\nThe Sardar who received such a Jagir \\nconsidered himself a Raja.\\nThere were many famous Maratha \\nSardars at the Courts of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur. The more famous among \\nthem were the Jadhavs of Sindkhed, Nimbalkars of Phaltan, Ghorpades of \\nMudhol, Moreys of Javali, Bhonsales \\nof Verul. The Sindkhed Jadhavs were \\ndescendants of the Yadavs of Devgiri. \\nJijabai, the mother of Shivaji Maharaj was the daughter of Lakhujirao Jadhav \\nof Sindkhed.Tradition of Valour : All these \\nSardars were brave but many of them \\nwere sworn enemies of one another. They \\nnever thought that they should unite and do something for their own people. So all their valour and bravery served the interests of others. Even so, they kept alive the warlike spirit, especially among the young. Many famous soldiers were born in their families who kept alive the tradition of valour.  Among the famous families, the Bhonsales of Verul showed great bravery and enterprise.\\nThe Temple of Ghrushneshwar :  It \\nwas about four hundred years ago. The temple of Ghrushneshwar near the Verul caves was falling to pieces. The walls had developed cracks. The priest also had deserted the temple. Thus the temple which was built in honour of a great god was totally neglected. All the devotees who came there mourned over the sorry state of the temple, but no one thought of repairing it.\\nA great devotee of Shiva visited the \\ntemple regularly. He would put flowers and ‘bel’ on the ‘lingam’ and express his innermost thoughts to the God. He carried out extensive repairs to the temple and restored it to its original condition. \\nHe also made arrangements for the \\nproper maintenance of the temple. Now \\nthere were lights both inside and outside \\nthe temple and the lost grandeur of Ghrushneshwar was restored. Who was \\nthis devotee who did all this  ? He was \\nMaloji Raje Bhonsale.\\n9Shahaji  Raje\\n\\n10The Bhonsales of Verul :  Maloji \\nRaje Bhonsale, the Patil of Verul, was a \\ngreat devotee of Shiva. Babaji Raje had two sons. Maloji Raje was the elder, and Vithoji Raje the younger. Babaji Raje Bhonsale had the rights of a Patil in the Verul village.\\nMaloji Raje and Vithoji Raje were \\nboth brave and enterprising. They had in their service many armed Maratha troops. It was a period of great unrest. The Moghul Emperor from Delhi had attacked the Kingdom of Nizamshah. Daulatabad was then the capital of Nizamshah. Malik \\nAmber was his Vazir or Chief Minister. \\nMalik Amber was able and wise. The \\ntwo capable and brave brothers from Verul soon caught his attention. On his recommendation, the Shah conferred on Maloji Raje the Jagir of Pune and Supe Parganas.\\nSo the Bhonsales became rich \\nand powerful. Maloji Raje’s wife was \\nUmabai. She came from the House of \\nthe Nimbalkars of Phaltan. They had two sons, Shahaji and Sharifji. Maloji Raje was killed in a battle at Indapur. At that time Shahaji was only five years old. Then Vithoji Raje looked after the children and the Jagir. Later, he asked in marriage for Shahaji, the daughter of Lakhujirao Jadhav. Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhujirao, was well favoured by the gods. Lakhujirao accepted Vithoji Raje’s proposal. Lakhujirao was a brave and valiant Sardar in the court of Nizamshah. He kept a large army of his own. He commanded great respect and honour at the court of Nizamshah. He celebrated the wedding of Shahaji Raje and Jijabai with great pomp. Jijabai became the Fortune of the Bhonsale family.\\nShahaji Raje :  Nizamshah \\ntransferred to Shahaji Raje the Jagir he had conferred on Maloji Raje. Shahaji Raje was a brave and capable man held in great respect at the court of Nizamshah. The Moghul Emperor decided to conquer the Kingdom of Nizamshah. For this, he made an alliance with the Adilshah of Bijapur. Malik Amber and Shahaji Raje fought bravely to save Nizamshahi. They defeated both the armies. This battle took place at Bhatawadi near Ahmadnagar. \\nSharifji was killed in the battle. Shahaji \\nRaje displayed great valour. He was \\npraised everywhere as a brave General. His reputation in the court was so enhanced that even Malik Amber began to feel jealous of him. This gradually led to  antagonism between them. As a result, Shahaji Raje left Nizamshahi and joined the court of Adilshah at Bijapur. Adilshah honoured him with the title of ‘Sar Lashkar’ (Chief of Army). Later, there were many developments \\nin Nizamshahi. The Vazir Malik Amber \\ndied. His scheming son Fattekhan became \\nthe Vazir of Nizamshahi. During his \\nperiod, the Nizamshahi began to decline. At about the same time, there was a threat of Moghul aggression. So, Nizamshah’s mother appealed to Shahaji Raje to return to Nizamshahi and save it. Therefore, Shahaji Raje left Adilshahi and returned to Nizamshahi.\\nlll\\n111.Fill in the blanks choosing the correct\\noption.\\n(a) Among the famous families, the .......... \\nof Verul showed great bravery and \\nenterprise.\\n(Moreys, Ghorpades, Bhonsales)\\n(b) Babaji Raje Bhonsale had two sons,\\nMaloji and ......... . \\n(Vithoji, Shahaji, Sharifji)\\n(c) .......... was a capable Vazir of\\nNizamshah.\\n(Malik Amber, Fattekhan, Sharifji)\\n2.Write the relation between :\\n(a) Maloji Raje - Vithoji Raje .......................\\n(b) Shahaji Raje - Lakhujirao Jadhav ........\\n(c) Shahaji Raje - Sharifji ...........................\\n(d) Babaji Raje - Vithoji Raje .......................\\n3.Match the pairs.\\n         ‘A’            ‘B’\\n(a) Sindkhed (1) Nimbalkar\\n(b) Phaltan (2) Ghorpade\\n(c) Javali (3) Bhonsale\\n(d) Mudhol (4) Morey\\n(5) Jadhav4.Give the answer in one sentence.\\n(a)  Who restored the temple of\\nGhrushneshwar to its original condition ?\\n(b)Which Jagir was bestowed upon Maloji\\nRaje by  Nizamshah ?\\n(c) Who fought bravely to save\\nNizamshahi ?\\n(d)With what title did the Adilshah honour\\nShahaji Raje ?\\n(e)Why did Shahaji Raje leave Adilshahi\\nand return to Nizamshahi ?\\nActivity\\nLocate places like Ahmadnagar, Phaltan, Verul, \\nSupe, Pune in the map of Maharashtra.\\nNote :  The word ‘Maratha’ here does not mean the ‘specific caste of an individual’.  \\nIt means ‘Marathi Speaking People’ or ‘Maharashtrians’.\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n12\\nThe Birthplace of Shivaji Maharaj at Fort Shivneri\\nBirth of Shivaji :  Those were very \\nunsettled days. Shahjahan from the \\nNorth had despatched a big army to conquer the Deccan. Pune, the principal town of Shahaji Raje’s Jagir was burned to the ground by Adilshah of Bijapur. Shahaji Raje was in real trouble. He found himself between the devil and the deep sea, and was constantly on the run.\\nJijabai was pregnant and the great \\nquestion which worried Shahaji Raje was  4. Shivaji’s Childhood\\nsome place where she could remain in safety and peace. Then he remembered the Shivneri fort and decided to send Jijabai there. Shivneri was a strong fort near Junnar in Pune district. It had steep cliffs on four sides, strong fortifications and massive doors. This strong fort was then in charge of Vijayraj, a relative of the Bhonsales. He agreed to give protection to Jijabai. So Shahaji Raje left her there and marched against the Moghuls.\\n13\\nVeermata Jijabai tells Shivaji stories of brave men.And then the golden day dawned. \\nOn the auspicious day of Phalgun Vadya \\nTritiya, in the year 1551 of the Shaka era, \\nthat is, on 19 February 1630, to the sound of pipes and drums playing in the ‘Nagar Khana’, Jijabai gave birth to a son. All the residents of the fort were overjoyed. On the twelfth day, with appropriate ceremony, the child was named ‘Shivaji’ \\nas the child was born on Fort Shivneri.\\nShivaji’s Childhood : Shivaji passed \\nthe first six years of his life in highly \\nunsettled conditions. Even so, Jijabai did not neglect his education. Every evening \\nshe would light the household lamps and \\nthen call Shivaji to her. She would shower \\nall her affection on him and tell him stories of Rama and Krishna, of Bhim and Abhimanyu. On other occasions she would recite to him the devotional  \\nsongs of Namdeo, Dnyaneshwar or Eknath. Shivaji liked to listen to the exploits of brave men. Shivaji felt that on growing up, he should also display valour like them. Jijabai used to tell him stories of many pious persons and saints. That instilled in him, a respect and honour for all saints and great men.\\nChildren from poor families came to \\nplay with Shivaji. Sometimes he visited them in their huts and shared their simple meal of onion and bhakri with great relish. They invented interesting games to pass the time. The children of the Mavlas were like birds in the forest. They would \\nimitate the sound of the cuckoo or parrot \\nor tiger to perfection. Their pastime was \\nbuilding small forts of earth and making earthern elephants and horses. They played hide and seek, or played with a ball or top. Shivaji joined them in all these games and became popular with them.\\n14Shahaji Raje towards the Moghuls   : \\nShahaji Raje returned to Nizamshahi all \\nright, but he did not get any peace of mind there. Nizamshah himself was a fickle-minded person who readily believed all gossip. Hence, many conspiracies and petty rivalries infested the court. This led to the killing of Lakhujirao Jadhav openly in the court at the instigation of Nizamshah himself. Shahaji Raje could not withstand this. Infuriated, he left Nizamshahi and joined the Moghuls. Shahjahan, the Moghul Emperor, made him a Sardar at his court.\\n In the meantime, secretly joining \\nhands with the Moghuls, Fattekhan killed Nizamshah. There was complete anarchy in the state. It became evident that Fattekhan was treacherously planning to enable the Moghuls to swallow Nizamshahi. In return, the Moghuls rewarded him with the territory under the control of Shahaji Raje. Shahaji Raje was enraged and so he left the services of the Moghuls. He decided to teach them a lesson using all his might.\\nFounding of a New Nizamshahi : \\nIn order to forestall the Moghul Emperor and Vazir Fattekhan, Shahaji Raje found out a child heir from the Nizam’s family and on the fort of Pemgiri near Junnar, declared him as the new Nizamshah. Thus, he established an altogether new kingdom which included the territory between the rivers Godavari and Nira. Shahaji Raje fought vigorously to protect this new state. Initially, Adilshah was with him in these efforts. But later, \\nShivaji with his Friends\\n15the Moghul Emperor Shahjahan himself \\nmarched South upon Shahaji Raje and threatened Adilshah. Adilshah then signed a treaty of friendship with him against Shahaji Raje. \\nShahaji Raje now began to fight the \\njoint forces of the Moghuls and Adilshah using guerrilla tactics. But he could not sustain the war all by himself. In 1636, unwillingly, he signed a treaty of peace with Moghuls. He could not create his own kingdom as the times were not favourable for him. But his daring spirit kindled a confidence among the Marathi \\npeople. This proved useful for Shivaji in \\nestablishing Swaraj a few years later.\\nJijabai and Shivaji in Karnatak :  \\nAfter the downfall of the Nizamshahi \\nestablished by Shahaji Raje, its territory \\nwas divided by the Moghuls and \\nAdilshah amongst themselves. Shahaji Raje’s Jagir of Pune and Supe lay within Adilshah’s share. He gave it to Shahaji Raje on his behalf. Now Shahaji Raje joined the Adilshahi services. Adilshah assigned to him, the task of conquering the territories in distant Karnatak, far away from Pune. Some time after the departure of Shahaji Raje to Karnatak, Jijabai and Shivaji also joined him there.\\n Shivaji’s childhood in Maharashtra \\nhad been very hectic. He and Jijabai had to rush continuously from one fort to another. At that time, young Shivaji used to hear the stories of the brave deeds of his father. Jijabai and Shivaji \\ngot some peace when they arrived in \\nKarnatak. Shahaji Raje defeated many \\nkings in Karnatak. Adilshah awarded him with the Jagir of Bangalore.

In the Bangalore court, he had under his patronage, artists and scholars of various languages. He appointed intelligent teachers for Shivaji. Shivaji’s education began when he became seven years old. Soon, Shivaji became skilled in the art of reading and writing. He began to read the stories from ‘Ramayan’, ‘Mahabharat’ and ‘Bhagwat’, on his own. To teach him warfare, Shahaji Raje had appointed some teachers. They began to teach Shivaji to ride a horse, to wrestle, to use swords and Dandpatta. Thus, at the age of twelve, Shivaji became acquainted with different branches of learning and arts. 5. Shivaji’s Education\\nShivaji’s Education under the Supervision of Shahaji RajeSoon, Adilshah sent Shahaji Raje \\non an expedition to conquer the States of the Nayakas (local chiefs) in Karnatak. Before setting out upon the expedition, Shahaji Raje sent Shivaji and Jijabai to Pune. With them, he sent elephants, horses, an infantry, a treasury, a flag, as also trusted ministers, brave generals and renowned teachers.\\nRejuvenation of Pune : Jijabai \\nand Shivaji returned to Pune. Shivaji remembered his childhood days which he had spent on Shivneri. He could see the lofty peaks of the Sahyadri again and he became very happy. Pune at that time was not such a big city. It was totally devastated by Shahaji Raje’s enemies. \\n18Properties were damaged. Houses were \\ndemolished. Temples had collapsed. The frightened people had fled from their villages. Fields had become barren. Thick forests had grown. Wolves roamed in the countryside. Pune, thus, was totally in shambles and ruins.\\n When the people living around \\ncame to know that Jijabai has returned to Pune with Shivaji, they took heart. Jijabai called all of them and reassured them that they would be safe in Pune. People started settling in Pune, cultivating their lands. Jijabai had the dilapidated temples repaired. In the temples, worship began morning and evening. The town was again throbbing with people. Thus, Pune was totally transformed.\\n The Achievements of Dadaji \\nKonddev : When Jijabai and Shivaji were in Karnatak, Dadaji Konddev looked after the Pune Jagir. He was the ‘Subhedar’ of Kondana also. He was very faithful. He was strict, efficient and honest in his work. He was also just, and a strict disciplinarian. He served with devotion. At about this time, a big wada or residence was built in Pune by the orders of Shahaji Raje. It came to be known as ‘Lal Mahal’. To encourage the peasants to till their lands, Dadaji gave them concessions in the land tax for a few years. He offered prizes for destroying the wolves which infested the countryside and harassed the peasants. Many wolves were killed. He raised peasant patrols to protect life and property from gangs of thieves who roamed the countryside. He fixed land revenue according to the quality of the soil. He thus made the people happy. In the fields of agricultural reform and revenue collection, the work done by Dadaji Konddev and the Nizamshahi Vazir Malik Amber is considered to be very important.\\n Shivaji’s Education :  When Shivaji \\nreturned to Pune, his education continued \\nunder the supervision of Jijabai. While returning from Bangalore, Jijabai and Shivaji were accompanied by eminent teachers sent by Shahaji Raje. They taught him many sciences, branches of learning and languages. \\n Shivaji acquired the knowledge of \\nexcellent administration, war tactics, fort architecture, selection of horses and elephants, ways of escaping from difficult enemy territories and many other things. Shivaji’s progress in education pleased Jijabai very much.\\nWhat Veermata Jijabai Taught \\nShivaji : Jijabai was no ordinary woman. She was the daughter of the mighty Sardar Lakhujirao Jadhav and the wife of the brave and valiant Shahaji Raje. She had inherited the knowledge of politics and warfare from her infancy. In her was witnessed the confluence of the martial traditions of the famous Houses of the Jadhavs and Bhonsales. She was a freedom loving person with a great sense of pride. She had learnt through bitter experience that however much a Maratha Sardar displayed valour, it was not appreciated in the courts of the Sultans. She had valiantly faced the shock of her father’s murder in the open court at the instigation of Nizamshah. She had \\n19Veermata Jijabai\\nresolved that her son Shivaji would never \\nbe engaged in the services of others. He \\nwould establish the rule of his own people \\n- Swaraj. She was bringing up Shivaji with that ideal.\\nThe people living in the Maval region \\nwere called Mavlas. They were loyal, \\nhardworking and quick-footed. No one could surpass them in hardiness. But they \\nwere harassed by the Sultans’ rule. The \\narmies of the Sultans used to plunder their villages, forcing the people to abandon their places. Nobody cared for them. Shivaji yearned to do something for these poor, miserable people.\\nOn returning home, Shivaji would \\ntalk about this to his mother. Jijabai would \\nsay, “Shivba, Shri Ramchandra is the  \\nancestor of the Bhonsales. Rama killed \\nRavan and made his people happy. The ancestor of the Jadhavs is Shri Krishna. \\nHe killed Kans and brought relief to his \\npeople. You are a descendant of both \\nShri Rama and Shri Krishna. You can \\nalso destroy the wicked and make your \\nsubjects happy.” \\nThese words of Jijabai were a source \\nof inspiration to young Shivaji. He would \\nremember the brave deeds of heroes of the \\npast like Rama, Krishna, Bhim, Arjun. \\nHe thought of them all the time, whether \\nasleep or awake. He felt that he, too, must \\nfight against injustice as they did, and like them, destroy the wicked and bring happiness to his subjects. He thought that he should become courageous and brave \\nlike these heroes of old.The New Regime of Shivaji :  In Pune \\nJagir, the new regime of Shivaji began \\nunder the guidance of Jijabai. Shahaji Raje had already made the preparations for this. When Shahaji Raje sent Shivaji from Bangalore to Pune, he sent some very powerful and prestigious people with him. They were Samraj Neelkanth Peshwe, Balkrishna Hanamante Muzumdar, Mankoji Dahatonde Sarnobat, Raghunath Ballal Sabnis, Sonopant Dabir. These were all able men fit to administer an independent kingdom. Shahaji Raje had specially deputed them to Pune to help \\n20Shivaji govern his Jagir efficiently. With \\ntheir help, Shivaji began to administer his Jagir, to attend the people’s grievances. Those who inflicted injustice upon the ryot were punished. In a way, Shahaji Raje’s Jagir was undergoing a transformation. The Mavlas got a glimpse of the future \\n‘Swaraj’. It was, as it were, the dawn of \\nSwaraj.\\n1.Fill in the blanks choosing the correct\\noption.\\n(a) Shahaji Raje was a scholar of .......... .\\n (Sanskrit, Kannad, Tamil)\\n(b) People living in the Maval region were \\ncalled .......... .\\n(peasants, soldiers, Mavlas)\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) Who appointed teachers for Shivaji and\\nwhere ?\\n(b) What did the teachers begin to teach \\nShivaji ?

So, Jijamata said, “We should now get Shivba \\nmarried.” Then a search for a suitable bride for Shivba began.  Soon she found the girl she wanted. Her name was Saibai. Saibai came from the Nimbalkar family of Phaltan. The marriage was celebrated with great splendour.\\n\\n21\\nThe Temple at Raireshwar :  To \\nthe south-west of Pune, there is a beauty \\nspot called Raireshwar famous for its temple. In the year 1645, an extraordinary event took place there. Shivaji and a few Mavlas from the neighbouring valley had gathered there. Why had they come to this lovely spot hidden in deep forest ? What did they discuss and what favour did they ask of Lord Shiva ?\\nThe Fiery Eloquence of Young \\nShivaji : Shivaji was still quite young \\nbut his mind was already busy planning big things. He opened his mind to his playmates and said, “My dear friends, today I am going to talk to you about something which is in my mind for a long time. My father Shahaji Raje is a Sardar at the court of Bijapur. It is he who has given me the charge of this Jagir. Everything is going on well and peacefully. But, friends, I am not happy. Must we always remain satisfied as bondmen of the Sultan ? Must we always eat out of other people’s hand ? We are surrounded on all sides by foreign kingdoms which are constantly at war. Our people get killed for nothing during these wars and family after family gets uprooted. Our country suffers destruction. And what do we get out of all this ? Nothing but slavery. How long shall we continue to tolerate this ? How long shall we lay down our lives for others ? Shall we allow this to continue just for the sake of a small Watan ? What have you to say about all this ?”6. The Oath of Swaraj\\nShivaji was speaking with great \\nemotion and his face was red with anger. In the middle of his speech he stopped and looked at his companions. The young Mavlas gathered there in the inner sanctum of Raireshwar were greatly thrilled by Shivaji’s speech. They had seen a new vision. One of them said, “Our young prince, tell us clearly whatever is in your mind. We are prepared, we are anxious to do your bidding.” “ Yes Raje,” they all said with one voice, “We are with you, we shall do whatever you say at the \\ncost of our lives if need be  !”\\nThe Oath of Swaraj : Shivaji \\ngot fresh inspiration from their words. Looking at each one of them he said, “Friends, our path is clear. We shall all strive to attain our ideal, work for it till it is achieved. All should be ready even to sacrifice their lives for this ideal which is ‘Hindavi Swaraj’. We will have our own Raj, yours and mine and everybody’s. We refuse to live as slaves any more. Let us take this oath with Lord Raireshwar as \\nwitness  ; we give ourselves completely \\nto the great task of establishing our own Raj, Swaraj.”\\nThe temple echoed the words of \\nShivaji. “God thinks that this Kingdom should take shape as Hindavi Swaraj. We shall see that God’s wish is fulfilled.”\\nSo the Mavlas left the temple, \\ncommitted to the oath of freedom, of Swaraj. The mind of Shivaji was filled \\n22\\nThe Oath of Swaraj\\n23with great joy. As soon as he reached Pune \\nhe went straight to Lal Mahal to see his \\nmother. He described to her all that took \\nplace at Raireshwar. Overjoyed, Jijabai \\nthought with satisfaction that Shivaji \\nwould accomplish what was always in her mind.\\nPreparations in the Maval \\nValley :  Shivaji soon got busy with \\nhis new activities. Along with his comrades he started intensive training \\nin swordsmanship, riding, exploring \\nthe secret paths in the hills and getting familiar with the general topography of \\nthe land, its valleys and ghats and possible \\ncommunication routes. He won over the \\nMavlas who became his most devoted \\nfollowers, willing to lay down their lives for him at any time. Shivaji’s enthusiasm \\nincreased a thousandfold. Shivaji made a \\ndetailed survey of all the forts and military \\nestablishments in the area. In this, his \\nfollowers were of great help to him. In the course of time, he came to know the  \\nsmallest detail of every establishment; \\nsecret pathways, underground routes, \\nammunition dumps and cellars.\\nFriends in Maval :  All over the \\ntwelve Mavals there were Deshmukhs, guarding their individual ‘Watans’ (gifted \\nland in lieu of service) to which they were \\nmore attached than anything else. There \\nwere constant quarrels between them leading to useless waste of money and \\nmanpower. Shivaji saw this waste and \\ndecided to put an end to it. He would visit \\nthe Deshmukhs in the area, talk to them, \\npersuade them to desist from their folly and raise before them a very attractive picture The Royal Seal\\nof the Swaraj of his dreams. He thus won many of them over to his side. He used \\nforce against those who were adamant. In \\nthis way he stopped the mutual warfare. \\nEverybody was pleased with this happy \\nresult and all started singing the praises of Shivaji. Zunjarrao Maral, Haibatrao \\nShilamkar, Baji Pasalkar, Vithoji Shitole, \\nJedhe, Paygude, Bandal were some of \\nthe Deshmukhs in the Maval valley \\nwho began to look upon Shivaji as their leader. The dream of Swaraj was fast \\napproaching the day of fulfilment.\\nShivaji’s Royal Seal : The Jagir was \\nalready being administered in the name of \\nShivaji.

But it was a  very \\ndifficult task. In those days, Maharashtra \\nwas governed by four different powers, \\nthe Moghul Emperor of Delhi, Sultan \\nAdilshah of Bijapur, the Portuguese of Goa and the Siddi of Janjira. They were \\npowerful opponents, firm in their authority. \\nNo one would dare utter a word against \\nthem. Under these difficult conditions \\nShivaji had taken the oath of Swaraj. There was no comparison between the \\nvast forces of the enemy and a handful \\nof Shivaji’s Mavlas. But Shivaji’s mind \\nwas made up and his firm resolve was his \\ngreatest source of strength.\\nTorana Fort : Shivaji controlled the \\nJagir of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur. 7. Swaraj : First Conquest\\nFort Torana (Zunjar Machi)All the forts in the Jagir were, however, in the charge of officers from the court \\nof Bijapur. He who controlled the forts \\nalso controlled the surrounding territory \\nand, therefore, all talk of Swaraj without \\nthe control of the forts was meaningless. A hill fort gave strategic support to the \\nruler and Shivaji decided to capture one \\nat a suitable time. For this purpose he had \\nselected the fort of Torana. It stands to the \\nsouth-west of Pune in the Kanad Valley. It was a renowned fort, well-suited for \\ndefence. There were two strong ‘Machis’ \\non the way to the fort. A ‘Machi’ is a \\nfortification of a natural plateau formed \\non the slope of a hill. One of these ‘Machis’ was the ‘Zunjar Machi’ and the other, the \\n‘Budhla Machi’. ‘Zunjar Machi’, like \\nits name, could offer powerful defence \\n26against the enemy. The only access to \\nthe fort was across the ‘Zunjar Machi’. \\nIt is a very difficult passage with high \\nhills on one side and deep valleys on the \\nother. A careless person may easily lose \\nhis balance and end his life in the deep valley. Torana was considered one of the \\nstrong forts of Maharashtra. In the fort \\nthere is a temple of the goddess Toranjai. \\nThat is why the fort is called Torana. \\nStrangely enough, this powerful fort was neglected by Adilshah. There were \\nneither enough troops for its defence nor \\nenough ammunition. Shivaji knew this \\nand this was exactly what he wanted. He \\ndecided to capture the fort and thus lay the foundation of Hindavi Swaraj.\\nThe drums of Swaraj begin to \\nsound  : With a few select bands of Mavlas, \\nShivaji descended into the Kanad Valley. \\nSwift-footed like the deer and lion-\\nhearted in courage, they raced to the top \\nand captured the strategic positions in the \\nfort. Tanaji Malusare hoisted the Maratha flag at the main entrance. Yesaji Kank,  \\na trustworthy and loyal companion of Shivaji, posted his guards at important \\npoints; the fort was captured almost \\nwithout any resistance and the sky was filled with shouts of “Shivaji Maharaj ki \\nJai”. The first battle drums and pipes of \\nHindavi Swaraj had sounded and their \\necho reverberated throughout the valley. \\nShivaji named this fort ‘Prachandgad.’\\nBlessings of Goddess Bhavani : \\nFort Torana then came under Shivaji’s administration. He made a very careful \\nsurvey of it and appointed officers such as a Maratha Killedar, a Brahmin Sabnis \\nand a Prabhu Karkhanis. The garrison included Mavlas, Kolis, Ramoshis, \\nMahars and such brave men from many \\nother castes and communities. In Swaraj \\nall castes and communities were to be \\ntreated alike and no distinctions made on the basis of caste. As repairs to the fort \\nstarted, a surprise awaited the people. \\nThey discovered four metal pots filled to \\nthe brim with mohurs. The workers were \\noverjoyed. They said that this was a gift to Shivaji from the Goddess Bhavani who \\nhad blessed his efforts. All the money \\ndiscovered was brought to Shivaji. No \\none thought of taking anything from it \\nfor himself. After all it was the wealth of Swaraj. Shivaji felt greatly elated at \\nthis unexpected gift which would enable \\nhim to pursue his ideal of Swaraj with \\nadded vigour. He felt that he was working \\nunder the benevolent eye of the goddess \\nBhavani. \\nShivaji utilised part of the treasure \\nfound in the fort to purchase arms and ammunition. The rest he decided to use \\nfor another project which was already in \\nhis mind. About fifteen kilometres to the \\neast of Torana is the hill of Murumbdeo. Shivaji had his eye on it for a long \\ntime. This hill was steep and difficult of \\naccess and, therefore, of great strategic \\nimportance. Adilshah had actually started \\nconstructing a fort on this hill but had left it unfinished. This hill also was not well-\\nguarded and Shivaji decided to capture it.\\nThe First Capital of Swaraj : One \\nday Shivaji climbed up the hill with a select \\n27\\nFort Rajgad - Pali Darwaja\\nband of his followers and took possession \\nof the partially completed fort. The money \\nfound on Torana was used to complete \\nthe fortifications of Murumbdeo. Shivaji \\nnamed this fort Rajgad. Stone masons, \\ncarpenters, blacksmiths, water carriers, other workers - all the people got busy. \\nThey built the Rajmahal, Bara Mahal and \\neighteen workshops. Rajgad became the \\nfirst capital of Swaraj.\\nShivaji’s Rapid Progress :  From \\nthen onwards, Shivaji moved swiftly and captured one fort after another in Maval. \\nThe whole country known as Bara Maval \\n- the twelve Mavals - was overflowing \\nwith joy and excitement. The Patils and \\nDeshmukhs from many villages came \\nand swore allegiance to Shivaji. But \\nMaval had its own share of black-legs \\nwho were ever ready to put a spoke in the fast moving wheel of Swaraj. Jealous \\nof Shivaji’s success, they complained \\nto the Adilshahi Collector at Shirval. The Collector despatched messengers \\nto Bijapur and informed Adilshah of \\nShivaji’s rapid progress.\\nShivaji the Shrewd Politician :  \\nAdilshah was most surprised to get the news. He asked Shahaji Raje for an \\nexplanation. Shahaji Raje got himself \\nout of this difficult situation by telling the Sultan that Shivaji Raje had probably taken over the fort for better administration \\nof the Jagir. Shivaji also sent this message \\nto the Sultan. “I have taken possession of the fort for better administration of \\nthe countryside. We did this only in the \\ninterest of the Sultan. There was no evil design at the back of this action.”\\nThe two forts of Kondana and \\nPurandar too had strategic locations. Shivaji used his political skill and took \\ncontrol of both the forts. The next fort \\nto come under his sway was Rohida. This was fast work indeed and there was \\nnothing to stop Shivaji now.\\n281.Fill in the blanks :\\n(a) Shivaji controlled the Jagir of Pune,\\nSupe, Chakan and ........ .\\n(Indapur, Saswad, Welhe)\\n(b) Shivaji decided to capture the fort of \\n........ and lay the foundation of Hindavi \\nSwaraj.\\n(Sinhagad, Shivneri, Torana)\\n(c) ........ became the first capital of Swaraj.\\n(Rajgad, Raigad, Pratapgad)\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) Which four different powers governed\\nMaharashtra in those days ?(b) What officers were appointed by Shivaji \\non the fort of Torana ?\\n(c) What message did Shivaji send to \\nAdilshah ?\\n3.Give reasons.\\n(a) Shivaji selected the fort of Torana to\\nlay the foundation of Swaraj.\\n(b) The workers brought the pots of mohurs \\ndiscovered on the fort of Torana to Shivaji.\\nActivity\\nArrange a trip to the nearest fort with the help of \\nyour teachers.\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n29\\nBy Use of Force : The Mavlas of the \\ntwelve Mavals gathered round Shivaji, \\nready to do his bidding. They lived for \\nSwaraj and were willing to die for it. \\nThey were simple Maratha folk. They loved Shivaji more than their life. But some people were jealous of Shivaji’s \\nachievements. He had to bring such \\npeople to book.\\nKhandoji and Baji Ghorpade were \\ntwo Sardars in the service of Adilshah. \\nThe Shah incited them against Shivaji. \\nThey created a lot of trouble in the Kondana district but Shivaji was more \\nthan a match for them. He defeated and \\ndrove them out.\\nBajaji Naik Nimbalkar of Phaltan \\nwas Shivaji’s own brother-in-law. But Shivaji Maharaj had to fight many battles against him. However, later on, members of this family stood by Shivaji Maharaj.\\nSambhaji Mohite of Supe, a near \\nrelative of Shivaji, also started plotting against Shivaji. Shivaji arrested him at Supe and banished him to Karnatak. With \\nShivaji, duty came first and relatives \\nafterwards.\\nChandrarao Morey of Javali : The \\ngreatness of Shivaji’s achievements was recognised and applauded everywhere. He \\ncaptivated the heart of his people. Some \\npeople did not like this. They looked upon Shivaji as a mole in the eye. The Morey 8. Defeat of Internal Enemies\\nof Javali was one such person. Morey was the Jagirdar of Javali. This Jagir which extended from Raigad to Koyna Valley, \\nalong with the title ‘Chandrarao’, was \\nconferred upon him by Adilshah. Javali was covered with such a thick forest that even during broad daylight, the sun’s rays \\nhardly penetrated it. It was full of wild life. \\nTigers, wolves and bears roamed freely in the Javali forest. Morey’s Javali was thus like a tiger’s hideout. No one, therefore, crossed Morey’s path. Only Shivaji had \\nthe courage to do so.\\nDaulatrao Morey died in 1645. There \\nwas fight for the succession among his \\ndescendants. Shivaji backed Yeshwantrao Morey who, with Shivaji’s help, ascended the ‘gadi’ as ‘Chandrarao’. In return for Shivaji’s help, Yeshwantrao promised to \\nhelp Shivaji in his struggle and also pay \\nhim an annual tribute. But he forgot all this once he succeeded to the ‘gadi’. He became impertinent and troublesome. He \\nstarted attacking Shivaji’s territory and \\nharassing the people. Shivaji realised that unless Morey was punished, he would remain a constant danger to Swaraj.\\n‘Rebel and you will die’ :  Shivaji  \\nfirst sent a stiff note to Yeshwantrao Morey, “You call yourself the Raja. But I am the Raja of this territory. This \\nKingdom is Lord Shiva’s gift to me. So do \\nnot call yourself the Raja.”\\n30In a very rude reply Yeshwantrao \\nsaid, “You are a Raja of only yesterday. \\nWho gave you this Kingdom ? If you \\ncome to Javali, you will be trapped. By \\nthe grace of God, I have received from Adilshah the title of ‘Raja’. He has also in his graciousness given me a throne and \\nthe panoply of a Raja. If you start any \\ntrouble here, you will be badly hurt.”\\nShivaji replied, “Give up Javali and \\nyour pretensions to Kingship. Come before \\nyour master with folded hands and accept \\nhis service. You will refuse to do so at the risk of your life.”\\nThe conquest of Javali was a \\ndifficult operation. It was covered \\nwith thick forest and protected by the \\nimpregnable Rairi fort. Morey also \\nFort Raigadhad numerous followers. Shivaji after making thorough preparations, attacked Javali. Yeshwantrao held out for about \\na month but suffered very heavy losses. \\nHe then escaped to Rairi along with his family. Shivaji conquered Javali and then marched on Rairi. He laid siege to Fort \\nRairi. Yeshwantrao fought desperately \\nfor three months but he had to give up.\\nFort Raigad : The conquest of Javali \\nwas a very important landmark. This \\ndoubled the boundaries of Swaraj under \\nShivaji. Yeshwantrao’s army, too, joined the forces of Shivaji. The strong Rairi fort \\nbecame a part of Swaraj. Shivaji was \\nhighly pleased to have this fort under his control. He changed its name to ‘Raigad’. \\nLater on, he built a new fort on the Bhorpya \\nhill nearby. It was named ‘Pratapgad’.\\n311.Find out the wrong pair.\\n(a) Phaltan  - Nimbalkar\\n(b) Javali  - Morey\\n(c) Supe -Jadhav\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a)What title was conferred by Adilshah\\nupon the Moreys of Javali ?\\n(b)Why was the conquest of Javali a very\\nimportant landmark ?3.Write the answers in two or three\\nsentences.\\n(a)Why did no one cross Morey’s path ?\\n(b) What note did Shivaji send to\\nYeshwantrao Morey ?\\nActivity\\n1.Collect pictures of Raigad.\\n2.Prepare a model of Raigad with the help of\\nyour friends, in your Diwali vacation.\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n32\\nAdilshah Perturbed :  The Court of \\nAdilshah at Bijapur was passing anxious \\ndays, due to the growing exploits of Shivaji. \\nThe Sultan summoned all his Sardars to \\ncourt to take stock of the situation. All the Sardars including those known for their exploits and those comparatively \\nunknown attended. Badi Saheba, the \\nDowager Queen, who personally looked after the Adilshahi administration from Bijapur was also present. The one question before the assembly was “How to bring \\nShivaji to book and break his revolt.” \\nBadi Saheba asked a straight question \\nto her Sardars, “Tell me, who is willing to \\nmarch against Shivaji and put an end to \\nhis rebellion?”\\nThe court became silent. Everybody \\nsat quietly in his place and started looking \\nat the next person, for who would dare \\naccept the challenge of fighting Shivaji ? \\nJust then a giant of a man came forward and bowed respectfully before the throne. His name was Afzalkhan.\\nThe Khan accepts the Challenge   : \\nThe Khan accepted the challenge and picked up the betel leaf from the salver as \\na mark of acceptance. “Shivaji. Who is \\nShivaji ?” he said, “ I shall arrest him and bring him here or if that is not possible,     I shall bring his dead body.”\\nAfzalkhan was one of the mighty \\nSardars at the court of Bijapur. His  physical prowess and strength were 9. Pratapgad makes History.\\nunbelievable. He could bend a crowbar with his bare hands. He was a past master in achieving his end by any available \\nmeans. This Afzalkhan had accepted the \\nchallenge of bringing Shivaji to court, dead or alive. The court was highly pleased. Everybody thought that it was \\nthe end of Shivaji and that he would be \\nbrought to Bijapur either alive or dead.\\nAfzalkhan left Bijapur in great pomp. \\nHe was accompanied by a huge army fully \\nequipped for battle. He was previously \\nthe Subhedar of Wai for twelve years and knew the country well. He marched on Maharashtra full of pride and confident of success.\\nSwaraj in Danger :  At this time \\nShivaji was at Rajgad. He got the news of Afzalkhan’s movements. He immediately saw that his Swaraj was in great danger. \\nBut he did not lose courage. He knew that \\nthe Khan was full of stratagem and had a huge army with him. Shivaji’s kingdom was very small in comparison and so was his army. He could see that he could \\nnever hold his own in open battle against \\nthe Khan. His only hope was in some strategic move that would take the Khan by surprise. In consultation with Jijabai \\nand with her blessings, Shivaji Maharaj \\nshifted his headquarters from Rajgad to Pratapgad.\\nAfzalkhan’s Counter-move :  When \\nthe Khan learnt that Shivaji had moved to \\n33\\nFort PratapgadPratapgad, he became very angry. He was \\naware of the difficulties in conquering \\nPratapgad. It was surrounded by thick \\nforest and high hills. There was no proper approach road to the fort and it was very \\ndifficult to move his artillery. Besides, the \\njungle was full of wild life.\\nThe Khan initiated many moves \\nin the hope of bringing Shivaji down to \\nthe plains. He attacked the holy cities of \\nPandharpur and Tuljapur. He harassed the people. He was hopeful that these \\ntactics would bring Shivaji down to the \\nplains. But Shivaji proved too clever for \\nhim. He refused to leave Pratapgad. Then \\nthe Khan changed his tactics. In a spirit of apparent friendliness he sent a message to \\nShivaji. “You are like a son to me. Come \\nand see me. Return our forts and I shall see that Adilshah makes you a Sardar at \\nhis court.”Tit for Tat : Shivaji quickly saw \\nthrough the Khan’s offer. He was taking \\nno chances. He decided somehow to \\npersuade the Khan to come up to the \\nfort. In reply to the Khan’s message he said, “Khansaheb, I am guilty of having captured your forts. I must have your \\npromise of pardon for this. Please come \\nand meet me at the foothills of Pratapgad. I am really afraid of coming down to the plains to meet you.”\\nThis reply of Shivaji pleased \\nAfzalkhan. Passing his fingers through his beard he smiled and said, “This is good news. What can Shivaji do against the mighty Afzalkhan? He has no guts to \\nfight me. I shall myself go to Pratapgad \\nand put an end to his life when we meet.” So he agreed to Shivaji’s proposal.\\nThe Meeting Place : The ‘Machi’ \\non Pratapgad was chosen as the meeting \\n34\\nplace. A date and time was fixed. It \\nwas agreed that each one would be \\naccompanied by a servant and followed by ten bodyguards at a distance. A special \\nroad was constructed for the convenience \\nof the Khan and a big shamiana put up for the meeting.\\nEvery move of Shivaji was marked \\nby great caution. He divided his army into small units. Each unit was told where to hide and when and how to act. He took \\nevery measure for safety and left nothing \\nto chance. Many of his advisers tried to dissuade him from meeting the Khan. \\nThe Khan’s word could not be trusted. \\nBut Shivaji brushed aside this advice and decided to meet the Khan as arranged.\\nBefore the Meeting :  On the day of the \\nmeeting, Shivaji visited Bhavani’s temple in the morning and took ‘darshan’. Soon after, he started putting on his ceremonial \\nclothes. He wore his Surwar and coat \\nof mail. Over the coat of mail, he wore a kurta and a flowing robe. On his head he placed the Jiretope (helmet) and tied a Mandil around it. He fitted Waghnakh \\nonto the fingers of his left hand. Hidden \\ninside the left sleeve was a Bichwa and he carried the Dandpatta in his hand. He was now ready to face the Khan.\\nAll the Sardars were waiting outside. \\nShivaji turned to them and said, “Friends, each one of you must carry out the duties assigned to you. I am sure the goddess Bhavani will see that we succeed. But if things go wrong and I am killed, do not lose heart. Install Sambhaji on the ‘gadi’, follow the commands of Maasaheb. Fight for Swaraj and extend its boundaries. \\nMake the subjects happy. I shall go now \\nto meet the Khan.” He was accompanied by his Vakil Pantaji Gopinath and ten \\nbodyguards including Jivaji Mahala, \\nSambhaji Kavji, Yesaji Kank, Krishnaji  Gaikwad, Siddi Ibrahim and others.\\nWhen Shivaji reached the shamiana \\nhe saw that the Khan had already arrived. He was busy planning his future moves. Standing by his side was an armed soldier, \\nBada Sayyad by name. He was highly \\nskilled in the use of Dandpatta. Shivaji came to the entrance of the shamiana, but on seeing Bada Sayyad, he stopped and would not proceed further.

Please ask him to go away.” \\nBada Sayyad moved away and Shivaji \\nstepped in. The Khan got up and said, \\n“Come, Shivaji Raje, let us embrace each other as a mark of our friendship.”\\nThe Struggle with the Khan  : \\nShivaji Maharaj cautiously took a step forward and the Khan took him in his \\nembrace. Compared to the giant Khan, \\nShivaji was short. He reached only as far as the Khan’s chest. At the same moment, the Khan held Shivaji’s neck in his iron \\ngrip and stabbed him on the side with his \\ndagger. It tore apart Shivaji’s robe but the coat of mail underneath saved him. Shivaji, knowing that the Khan was trying to kill him, quickly thrust the Waghnakh \\nin the Khan’s stomach. Drawing out the \\nBichwa with his right hand, he drove it into the Khan’s stomach and tore apart his guts. The wounded Khan fell down. Khan’s Vakil, Krishnaji Bhaskar, came forward and attacked Shivaji with his sword. But Shivaji killed him with one \\nstroke of the Patta. When Bada Sayyad \\nheard the shouts and noise he rushed into the shamiana. As he was about to strike Shivaji, Jivaji Mahala came between \\nthem and killed Bada Sayyad with one \\nstroke. ‘Because of Jiva, Shiva was saved’ became a common saying afterwards.Sambhaji Kavji displayed great bravery in this conflict.\\nThe Rout of the Afzalkhan’s Army   : \\nThus with triumph Shivaji went up to the fort. The gun boomed and gave the \\nsignal. On the instant, Shivaji’s troops \\ncame out of their hiding and attacked the Khan’s army. The Khan’s army was \\n36completely unprepared for the attack and \\nwas caught in a difficult terrain. They could not even run away to save their lives. The Maratha troops chased them in hot pursuit and destroyed the whole of the Khan’s powerful army. Fazalkhan, Afzalkhan’s son who escaped with great difficulty, reached Bijapur. His account of the disastrous campaign spread gloom over the whole of Bijapur.\\nShivaji thus humbled the most \\npowerful Sardar of the Bijapur Court. His fame spread everywhere.

This threw Adilshah into a fit of wild rage. He could neither eat nor sleep. \\nHe despatched another Sardar, Siddi \\nJauhar, against Shivaji.  Siddi Jauhar had a huge army with him. Fazalkhan who wanted to avenge his father’s death, also accompanied him. \\nThe Siege of Panhalgad : Siddi  \\nJauhar was brave but ruthless. He was a strict disciplinarian. He laid siege to Panhalgad and confined Shivaji within the \\nfort. The rainy season was approaching \\nand Shivaji thought that once the rains came, Siddi Jauhar would lift the siege. But Siddi Jauhar did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, with the arrival of the \\nmonsoon, he further tightened the siege. \\nSupplies in the fort were running out. Shivaji was in a fix. Since he could not force Siddi Jauhar to lift the siege by \\nan open battle, he decided to deceive \\nSiddi Jauhar by a clever ruse. He sent a message to Siddi Jauhar to the effect that \\nhe would shortly surrender the fort. Siddi \\nwas happy.\\nSiddi’s troops were already tired of \\nthe long siege. They were very pleased to hear that Shivaji agreed to surrender. They relaxed the watch and indulged in food, drink and music.\\nShivaji Escapes from the Siege :  \\nA plan was hit upon to escape from the siege. Two palanquins were kept ready. One was meant for Shivaji in which \\nhe would proceed using a difficult \\nroute. The other would  be occupied by another person disguised as Shivaji. This palanquin was to leave by the ‘Raj-dindi’. This other palanquin would \\nbe easily spotted by the enemy forces, \\nand it would be captured by them. While the enemy celebrated the capture of \\nShivaji, the real Shivaji would escape \\nby the difficult route. This was the plan. For this a brave youth undertook this \\ntask. He resembled Shivaji in looks. \\nHis name was Shiva Kashid. He was a hairdresser in Shivaji’s service. He was courageous and shrewd.\\nAs planned, the palanquin carrying \\nShiva Kashid came out of Raj-dindi. It was a dark night and it was raining \\nheavily. Still, some enemy soldiers \\nwere keeping watch. They captured the palanquin. They thought that they had caught Shivaji himself and took the \\npalanquin to Siddi’s camp. Jubilations \\nbegan in the camp. In the meanwhile, \\nShivaji escaped from the fort by the \\ndifficult route. He was accompanied by Baji Prabhu Deshpande and some select 10. Baji Prabhu and the Memorable Battle of Ghodkhind\\n38soldiers. The Bandal Deshmukh army \\naccompanied them. After some time, the plot of Shiva Kashid was exposed. The \\nfurious Siddi killed him then and there. \\nShiva Kashid sacrificed his own life in the cause of Shivaji and Swaraj. Thus, he became immortal.\\nWhen the Siddi learnt that Shivaji \\nhad given him the slip, he was livid with rage. Immediately, he despatched his Sardar Siddi Masaud, accompanied by \\na big army, in hot pursuit of Shivaji. At \\ndaybreak, the pursuing horsemen caught up with Shivaji at the Pandharpani stream. Shivaji was now in real trouble. With the greatest difficulty he and his men crossed \\nthe Ghodkhind.\\nBaji Prabhu, the Brave : The angry \\ntroops of Siddi were fast galloping \\ntowards the Ghodkhind pass. Shivaji saw \\nthat it was impossible to reach Vishalgad \\nbefore the enemy overtook them. He said to Baji Prabhu, “Baji, this is a very critical situation. The road ahead is steep and the enemy is right on our heels. It is \\nnow impossible to reach Vishalgad. So \\nlet us turn back and face the enemy.” Baji Prabhu understood the great agitation going on in Shivaji’s mind. The enemy \\nwas fast approaching the pass. The life \\nof Shivaji and, therefore, Swaraj, was in danger. He said, “Maharaj, you must proceed to Vishalgad. Take a handful of soldiers with you. I shall defend this pass \\nand will not let the enemy cross it. I shall \\nlay down my life in defence of this pass if need be. If I die, there will be many other Bajis to take my place. But no one \\ncan replace you. Our Swaraj needs you. The enemy will attack in large numbers. \\nWe cannot hold out against them with \\nour limited force. Please do not wait. Go ahead. We shall stop the enemy at the entrance to the pass. We shall not \\nlet him advance till we know that you \\nhave reached Vishalgad safely.” Baji Prabhu’s brave words and his sense of loyalty brought tears to Shivaji’s eyes. He was most unwilling to sacrifice this \\ngem of a man for his personal safety. But \\nhe had no time to think of these things. \\nHe wanted to achieve his ideal of Swaraj. \\nHe fondly embraced Baji and said, “We \\nshall move ahead towards Vishalgad. \\nAs soon as we gain the fort, guns will be \\nfired. That will be the signal of our safe \\narrival. As soon as you hear the gun-fire, \\nabandon the pass and follow us to the \\nfort.”\\nBaji’s Defence of the Ghodkhind \\nPass : So Shivaji left for Vishalgad \\nleaving Baji Prabhu to defend the pass. \\nBaji made a low bow to the receding \\nfigure of Shivaji and then prepared himself for battle. He took a sword in his \\nhand and stood at the entrance of the pass. \\nHe divided his company of soldiers into \\nsmall groups and posted them at suitable points. The Mavlas took their positions \\nand collected huge boulders and stones to \\nbe used as weapons. The Mavlas across \\nthe pass were now a strong barrier in \\nthe path of the enemy. By this time the \\nenemy had reached the mouth of the pass \\nand one could hear their war cries. Baji \\n39\\nShivaji and Baji Prabhu Deshpande in Ghodkhind\\n40addressed his troops and said, “My brave \\nsoldiers and comrades, be prepared. You may die fighting but do not desert your \\npost. Do not allow the enemy to conquer \\nthe pass, no matter what price has to be paid.” So Baji Prabhu and his Mavlas stood at the mouth of the pass, firm and \\nfearless, awaiting the enemy. The pass \\nwas difficult to cross, there being only a narrow and a zigzag passage across it. \\nAt the other end, Shivaji was speeding \\ntowards Vishalgad. The fort was still some distance away and it would take \\nShivaji at least two hours to reach it. If \\nBaji Prabhu could hold out for those two hours, Shivaji would be safe.\\nThe Battle of Ghodkhind : By now \\nthe enemy was at the mouth of the pass \\nwhere a fierce battle was in progress. The \\nMavlas who were adept at the use of the sling harassed the enemy with showers of stones and boulders from the hill-top and killed many of them. The first \\nbatch of the attacking troops withdrew in \\nconfusion. Another batch took their place. \\nBaji Prabhu urged his troops into the \\nattack. The Maratha war cry “Har Har \\nMahadeo” echoed through the hills and \\nthe brave Mavlas cut down the enemy \\ntroops in the fierce and desperate attack. Through the din of battle they heard \\ntheir captain shouting encouragement to  \\nthem : “Bravo, my lads, go ahead, attack and destroy the enemy”. The second batch of the enemy troops was also defeated.\\nShivaji was by now, almost at the \\nfoot of Vishalgad. Vishalgad was also besieged by the enemy. Shivaji fought through the ranks of the besieging troops \\nand was on the last lap of his ride to safety.\\nBaji the Brave :  In the meantime, \\nthe battle at the pass continued unabated. Enraged at the defeat of his first two attacks, Siddi Masaud organized and despatched a third batch of troops against \\nBaji Prabhu and his brave men. They \\nsurrounded Baji Prabhu who fought with great courage. Though wounded and attacked from all sides, with his \\nbody covered with blood, Baji would not \\nwithdraw from the pass but continued the fight. At the same time, he urged his Mavlas to attack the enemy. Disheartened by the fearful attack, the enemy again \\nwithdrew. But Baji was fatally wounded. \\nHe was hanging on to life just to hear the sound of gun-fire from Vishalgad.\\nGhodkhind becomes Pavan Khind : \\nAnd then the sound of gun-fire was heard from Vishalgad. “Maharaj has reached Vishalgad. I have done my duty. Now I can die in peace.” So saying, Baji breathed his last on this historic battlefield. When \\nShivaji heard this news on Vishalgad, he \\nwas greatly grieved. He exclaimed, “Baji Prabhu Deshpande laid down his life on \\nthe battlefield in the cause of Swaraj. The \\nBandals gave a great battle.”\\nIt was because of brave patriots like \\nBaji Prabhu that Swaraj was won. Their blood made the Ghodkhind a place holy in Swaraj.

Every Sardar \\nof Bijapur who was sent against Shivaji was defeated. Adilshah at last gave up the fight, made peace with Shivaji and gave \\nrecognition to his independent Kingdom. \\nShivaji thus had peace for some time on his southern border.\\nIn the meanwhile, constant  \\nMoghul attacks from the north had practically ruined Maharashtra. Shivaji, therefore, turned his attention northwards \\nand carried out raids in the territory \\nof the Moghul Emperor, Aurangzeb. This enraged Aurangzeb and he sent \\nShaistakhan, his uncle, to deal with Shivaji \\nand teach him a lesson. Shaistakhan with a huge army of 75,000 men and hundreds of elephants, camels and pieces of cannon marched on Pune. On the \\nway he captured the towns of Shirval, \\nShivapur, Saswad and finally laid siege to the fort of Purandar. Nothing could stop his advance. But once the Maratha army surrounded him in a mountain pass. \\nThe Maratha troops moved very fast on \\ntheir swift Bhimthadi ponies. They also \\ntravelled very light. They could traverse \\nthe hills and valleys in the shortest possible \\ntime on army rations consisting of onions and bajra bread. This type of warfare, perfected by the Marathas, was unknown \\nto Shaistakhan. Tired of the continuous 11. The Discomfiture of Shaistakhan\\nharassment by the Maratha troops, he at \\nlast raised the siege of Purandar.\\nFirangoji Narsala : Shaistakhan \\nthen continued his march on Pune. First \\nhe captured the fort of Chakan. Firangoji \\nNarsala fought to defend the fort with \\ngreat bravery and skill against the \\narmy of Shaistakhan. For two months he kept Shaistakhan at bay, but he was \\nhelpless against the guns of Shaistakhan. \\nShaistakhan was much impressed with \\nthe way Firangoji defended the fort and \\noffered him service with the Moghul Emperor. Firangoji however refused this \\ntempting offer.\\nShaistakhan in Lal Mahal : \\nShaistakhan came to Pune and made \\nLal Mahal, Shivaji’s residence, his \\nheadquarters. One year passed, then \\nanother year. Shaistakhan would not leave Pune. On the contrary, his troops would \\nraid Shivaji’s territory, destroy crops and \\ntake away the cattle. In this way he started \\ndevastating the surrounding countryside.\\nA Bold Plan : At last Shivaji decided \\nto teach Shaistakhan a lesson. In a way it was good that Shaistakhan was staying \\nin Lal Mahal. Shivaji knew the place \\ninside out, with all its entrances and exits, \\nits secret passages, doors and windows. \\nBesides, Shivaji’s spies were keeping \\nhim well informed about the disposition of the Khan’s troops. Shivaji, therefore, \\ndecided to enter Lal Mahal one night and \\nkill Shaistakhan. This was indeed a very \\n43\\nShivaji attacks Shaistakhan.\\nbold plan. Lal Mahal was so well guarded \\nthat even an ant would find it difficult to \\nget through. 75,000 troops were camping \\noutside the palace. No armed Maratha \\nwas allowed to enter the town. But \\nShivaji had made up his mind and there was none who could turn him away from \\nhis resolve.\\nShivaji fixed the date to carry out the \\nplan. On the night of 5th April, 1663, a \\nmarriage procession was passing  along \\nthe streets of Pune. There was music, and \\nfireworks accompanied the procession. Hundreds of people dressed in fine clothes were in the procession. Some \\nwere in Palanquins, others in ‘Menas’, \\nwhile many more were on foot. Shivaji with his band of trusted followers joined \\nthe procession to give the impression that \\nthey were a part of it. After some time \\nthe procession proceeded on its way, but \\nShivaji and his men moved away quietly \\nin the direction of Lal Mahal. Shaistakhan \\nwas fast asleep at   this hour.\\nShaistakhan Learns a Lesson : \\nShivaji made a hole in the wall and entered Lal Mahal. He had no trouble in finding \\nhis way about, because it was after all, \\n44his own house. The Khan’s bodyguards \\nwere half asleep. Shivaji’s followers tied them up. Shivaji went deeper inside. Suddenly, someone rushed at him with a sword. Shivaji killed him. He thought it was Shaistakhan, but it was his son. There was a commotion. People woke up. \\nShivaji went straight to the Khan’s \\nchambers and took out his sword. Terrified, the Khan started shouting ‘the Devil, the Devil’ and tried to escape through the window. Shivaji struck him with the sword which cut off three fingers of the Khan.  The Khan could have lost his life, but he escaped with the loss of three fingers only. The Khan jumped out of the window and made for safety. To deceive the Khan’s troops, Shivaji and his men raised the cry, “Shivaji has attacked. Run, catch him,” and started to run themselves. The Khan’s troops also started running in all directions. In the confusion that followed, Shivaji and his men made their escape and reached Sinhagad. The Khan’s troops spent the whole night looking in vain for Shivaji and his troops. \\nThis incident took the fight out of \\nShaistakhan. He was afraid that if he lost only his fingers in the first attack, Shivaji might cut his head off in the second. Aurangzeb was furious when he heard of this episode. Shaistakhan lost the Emperor’s favour and was transferred to Bengal. \\nThis was the first serious blow to the \\nMoghul Power. Shivaji had successfully bearded the lion in his own den. Gunfire announced the victory and a wave of joy went all over Maharashtra.\\n1.Fill in the blanks :\\n(a) Shaistakhan laid siege to the fort of\\n........... .\\n(Purandar, Panhala, Shivneri)\\n(b) In Pune, Shaistakhan made ............ his \\nheadquarters.\\n (Shaniwar Wada, Lal Mahal, Parvati)\\n(c) Aurangzeb transferred Shaistakhan to \\n............... .\\n(Assam, Karnatak, Bengal)\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) Which towns did Shaistakhan capture\\non the way to Pune ?\\n(b) Why did Shaistakhan at last raise the \\nsiege of Purandar ?\\n(c) What was Shaistakhan afraid that might \\nhappen ?3.Give reasons.\\n(a) Emperor Aurangzeb was enraged and\\nsent Shaistakhan to deal with Shivaji.\\n(b) Shaistakhan tried to escape through the \\nwindow.\\n4.Write  the  incidents  or events \\nchronologically :\\n(a) Shivaji and his men departed towards \\nSinhagad fort.\\n (b) Shaistakhan made Lal Mahal his \\nheadquarters.\\n(c) Shaistakhan captured the fort of Chakan.\\n(d) Shivaji taught Shaistakhan a lesson.\\nActivity\\nArrange a trip to visit Lal Mahal.\\nEXERCISES\\n\\n45\\nRaid on Surat : After this triumph, \\nShivaji did not sit idle. Aurangzeb’s \\ntroops were laying waste the whole of \\nMaharashtra. To bring the Emperor to his \\nsenses, Shivaji carried out his daring raid \\non Surat. Surat was so far away from Pune that no one but Shivaji could have thought \\nof this daring raid. Surat was then a great \\ncentre of trade in the Moghul empire and \\na very rich city. Shivaji carried out the \\nraid successfully and brought home a booty worth lakhs of rupees. Shivaji did \\nnot forsake ethics in the raid on Surat. He \\nspared the churches and mosques. He did \\nnot show disrespect to women.  \\nFort Purandar12. The Siege of Purandar and \\nthe Treaty with the Moghul Emperor\\nThe raid on Surat drove Aurangzeb \\ninto a furious rage. He now decided to put an end to the Maratha Kingdom. He \\nordered his great general, Mirza Raje \\nJaising, to humble Shivaji. To assist Mirza Raje in the campaign, he sent with him his trusted Sardar, Dilerkhan. The \\ntwo landed in the Deccan with a huge \\narmy and unlimited funds. Swaraj was in real danger.\\nImmediately after his return from the \\nexpedition of Surat, in 1664 AD, Shivaji Maharaj heard a sad news. Shahaji Raje had suffered an accidental death while on \\n46a hunt. Shivaji and Jijabai were greatly \\ngrieved. Holding his mother close to his bosom, Shivaji Maharaj consoled her. \\nSiege of Purandar by the Moghul \\nArmy : Purandar was one of Shivaji’s \\nbig and strong forts. Dilerkhan knew that Shivaji could not be defeated as long \\nas he was the master of Purandar. He, \\ntherefore, laid siege to this powerful fort. He had a huge army under his command. Murarbaji was in charge of the fort. He \\nwas a determined fighter who would \\nnot easily yield to threats. He was also supported by brave troops. With their help Murarbaji decided to defend the fort. \\nDilerkhan’s guns went into action. \\nFiery cannon balls began to drop on the fort. Murarbaji and his brave men held on. The first bastion on the ‘Machi’ collapsed under gun-fire. Dilerkhan’s troops \\ncaptured the lower fort. The Marathas \\nwithdrew to the upper fort and continued to fight. Dilerkhan was watching the battle from his camp. \\nFurious with rage, Murarbaji decided \\nto attack the Moghul troops with a select contingent of five hundred men. He opened the gates of the upper fort. Shouting their war cry, “Har Har Mahadeo,” the Mavlas fell on the Moghul troops. After a fierce \\nbattle which lasted for a short time, the \\nMarathas routed the huge Moghul army which fled towards Dilerkhan’s camp.\\nMurarbaji followed them in hot \\npursuit. With his troops he entered the camp of Dilerkhan and wrought havoc there. The enemy troops were in flight and the Marathas in pursuit. Cries and \\nshouts filled the whole camp. In great \\nhurry Dilerkhan mounted his elephant \\nand looked ahead. There was Murarbaji hacking the soldiers to pieces. His sword \\nmoved like lightning, cut throats, broke \\nheads and pierced the hearts of the enemy. No one could stop him or hold him in \\ncheck. Dilerkhan watched in admiration \\nhis great deeds of bravery.\\nMurarbaji’s Incomparable Valour   : \\nSeeing Dilerkhan, Murarbaji asked his \\ntroops to attack in full force and himself \\nadvanced towards Dilerkhan. Whoever tried to obstruct him was cut to pieces. \\nThe Moghul troops at last surrounded \\nMurarbaji on all sides. Just then Dilerkhan \\nshouted, “Wait ; Hold back your swords   !” \\nThe Moghul troops halted and moved back a little. Then Dilerkhan addressed \\nMurarbaji, “Until now I have not seen a \\nswordsman like you. You come over to our side. I promise you complete safety. \\nThe Emperor will make you a Sardar, and \\nreward you with a Jagir”. His eyes red with anger, Murarbaji said in return, “We \\nare the loyal servants of Shivaji Maharaj. \\nWho wants to buy safety from you\\n ? Why \\nshould we come over to your side  ? And \\nwho wants your Emperor’s Jagir  ?” He \\nthen moved forward in the direction of Dilerkhan and again started attacking his \\nsoldiers. Dilerkhan who was seated in the \\nhoudah on the elephants back, released \\nan arrow which pierced Murarbaji’s neck. \\nMurarbaji fell to the ground. His followers lifted his dead body and took it back to \\n47\\nThe Battle between Murarbaji Deshpande and Dilerkhan\\nthe upper fort. ‘What if one Murarbaji is \\nfallen ! We, too, are brave like him. We will fight with courage.’ Saying so, they \\nbegan to fight again without losing heart.\\nShivaji heard the news with great \\nsorrow. He knew that he could hold each \\none of his forts against the Moghul army for at least more than a year. But he was \\nunwilling to do so at the cost of his men \\nwho would die in the attempt.\\nTreaty of Purandar : What could be \\ndone\\n ? He was not strong enough to fight \\nthe powerful Moghuls. All his political skill was also of no avail. There was only \\none thing he could do. He decided on a temporary withdrawal from the fight. He \\nwould enter into a treaty with the Moghul Emperor. He went and saw Jaising. This was a very sensible and statesmanlike thing to do. He said to Jaising, “Mirza Raje, you are a Rajput. You can understand our suffering. The Emperor’s campaigns have laid the country waste and people are in great misery. I have undertaken this task of establishing Swaraj so that people may be happy. You should join me in this uphill task. If you agree to lead us, myself and my Mavlas will be your trusted followers.” Jaising was a shrewd diplomat. He persuaded Shivaji to sign \\n48\\nShivaji Maharaj meets Mirza Raje Jaising.\\na treaty of peace with the Emperor. \\nShivaji signed the treaty and according \\nto its terms, twenty-three forts and a \\nterritory with a revenue of four lakh Hons  \\n(a gold coin) were to be handed over to the Emperor. The treaty of Purandar was signed in 1665.\\nAfter the treaty was signed, Jaising \\nsuggested to Shivaji that he should go to Agra and see the Emperor. He also guaranteed Shivaji’s safe return. Shivaji thought over the suggestion. He knew that the Emperor could not be trusted. He had \\nproved treacherous to his own brothers. \\nBut, in the end, Shivaji decided to take the risk and face the situation as cautiously as he could. He informed Jaising that \\nhe was willing to go to Agra to meet the \\nEmperor.\\nlll\\n491.Fill in the blanks :\\n(a) ........... was a great centre of trade in the \\nMoghul empire.\\n(Pune, Surat, Delhi)\\n(b) ........... was in charge of the fort of \\nPurandar.\\n(Baji Prabhu, Tanaji, Murarbaji)\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) Why did Shivaji carry out a raid on\\nSurat ?\\n(b) Why did Dilerkhan lay siege to the \\nPurandar fort ?\\n(c) Why did Shivaji enter into a treaty with \\nthe Moghul Emperor ?\\n(d) According to the treaty of Purandar, \\nwhat territory was to be handed over to \\nthe Moghuls ?\\nEXERCISES\\n3.Write the answer in two or three sentences.\\n(a) What did Dilerkhan say to Murarbaji on\\nseeing his valour ?\\n(b) What did Murarbaji say in return ?\\n4.Complete these names from the lesson\\nwith the help of the given first letters.\\n(a)  Au  ........................\\n(b)  Pu  ........................\\n(c)  Mu  ........................\\n(d)  Ja  ........................\\n(e)  Di  ........................\\nActivity\\nArrange a trip to visit a fort nearby.

Before \\nleaving for Agra, Shivaji handed over the \\nadministration of his Swaraj to his mother \\nJijabai and took her blessings. With him \\nwere his son Sambhaji Raje, some chosen \\nSardars, and a few trusted people. He also carried with him a large treasure. In due \\ncourse he reached Agra.\\nShivaji Shows his Spirit at the \\nEmperor’s Court : On a prearranged \\nday Shivaji Maharaj attended the \\nEmperor’s Darbar. Young Sambhaji Raje \\nShivaji Maharaj in the Emperor’s Courtaccompanied him. It was Aurangzeb’s \\nfiftieth birthday. After finishing court in Diwan-i-Khas, the Emperor entered the hall where matters of state were discussed.\\nIn front of him stood his chief Sardars \\nin serial ranks according to their status. Jaswantsing Rathod whom the Marathas had put to flight on many occasions was \\nin the rank ahead of Shivaji. The Emperor \\nput Shivaji in one of the back rows. Shivaji \\nbecame angry. After all, he was the King \\nof the sovereign State of Maharashtra \\nand his status dema nded that he should \\n51be in the front rank. This was a deliberate \\ninsult which he would not suffer lying down. Angry and insulted, he turned his back on the royal presence and made for his residence. He decided never to see the Emperor’s face again.\\nThe visit was thus a failure. The news \\nof the incident spread everywhere.\\nThe Emperor’s Treachery : \\nAurangzeb ordered guards to be posted around Shivaji’s residence. Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Raje thus became, for all practical purposes, the Emperor’s prisoners. Shivaji understood the Emperor’s treachery. He realised that the Emperor would never let him return to Maharashtra.\\nDays and weeks passed. Then, \\none  day, Shivaji Maharaj petitioned to the Emperor for permission to return to Maharashtra. He tried again and again, but every time his request was turned down. Then Shivaji Maharaj made up his mind to escape from the Emperor’s clutches, come what may. To begin with, he obtained the Emperor’s permission to send back to the South the persons who had accompanied him to Agra. The Emperor was happy. He thought that Shivaji Maharaj would now be completely isolated. The only persons left with him now were Sambhaji Raje and the two servants Hiroji Farjand and Madari Mehetar.\\nSoon after, Shivaji Maharaj \\npretended to be ill. He complained of severe pain in the stomach. Doctors were called. They started treating the patient. Shivaji started sending out huge baskets \\nof sweets to Sadhus and Maulavis for his quick recovery.\\nEscape from Agra : In the beginning \\nthe guards outside would examine the baskets. In the course of time they got tired of this daily routine and stopped it. One evening Shivaji made Hiroji sleep in his bed and asked Madari to massage his feet. Then Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Raje hid themselves in two of the many baskets that were going out. The baskets were supposed to contain sweets and allowed to pass unchecked. At a place previously fixed, Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Raje got out of the baskets. Their faithful servants were waiting for them with horses kept ready for flight. In the meantime, Hiroji and Madari left the house in Agra under the pretext that they were going to the doctor to get some medicine. The two of them risked their own life and made a valuable contribution to the task of freeing Maharaj from imprisonment.\\nThe Emperor came to know of \\nShivaji’s escape the next day. He was wild with rage. His Sardars were frightened. The Emperor sent spies all over the country to trace Shivaji. All the search, however, was in vain. Once escaped, the Maratha lion was never again caught in the Emperor’s net. In disguise, Shivaji Maharaj started towards Maharashtra. He left young Sambhaji Raje behind in a safe place at Mathura and in due course, reached Rajgad. Jijamata was overjoyed to see Shivaji safe and back home. Two \\n52months later, Sambhaji Raje also arrived \\nsafely at Rajgad.

One day Jijamata said to Shivaji, “Shivba, it is not safe to leave the strong Kondana fort in enemy hands. You must \\nrecapture it.” Shivaji was thinking on \\nthe same lines. He was very unhappy that Kondana was in Moghul hands. Both Shivaji and Jijabaisaheb were very unhappy about it. It was like a thorn in \\ntheir side. Shivaji started making his \\nplans for the recapture of Kondana. Who  14. The Fort is captured but the Lion is dead.\\ncould be entrusted with this task  ? It was \\nvery difficult to capture Kondana. \\nTanaji Malusare : Tanaji was \\nShivaji’s comrade right from the beginning. He came from the village Umrathe near Mahad in the Konkan. He was ever ready to put his heart and soul into any work assigned to him by \\nShivaji. Tanaji was strong and well-built, \\nand as clever as he was brave. He was passionately devoted to Shivaji.\\nKondana’s Marriage First :  Tanaji \\nwas busy making preparations for his \\n54\\nson Raiba’s wedding. Everyone in \\nthe house was busy with the marriage \\npreparations. The marriage \\nwas only four days away. \\nTanaji thought that he \\nwould go and invite \\nShivaji Maharaj \\nand Maasaheb \\nto the wedding. \\nAccompanied by \\nShelarmama, he \\nTanaji’s Assault on Kondanawent to Shivaji Maharaj to give him and \\nMaasaheb his personal invitation to the wedding. On receiving the invitation from \\nShelarmama, Shivaji said, “Shelarmama, \\nyou go back and celebrate the wedding. I am sorry I shall be unable to attend. I have decided to lead a campaign for the \\nrecapture of Kondana.” \\nAs soon as Tanaji heard this he said, \\n“Maharaj, do you propose to undertake \\nthis difficult and dangerous campaign \\nwhile Tanaji is still alive ? Then what is \\nthe use of persons like me ? This will not do. I shall first perform the marriage of Kondana by capturing it. Raiba’s wedding can wait. You must allow me to lead this \\ncampaign and give me your blessings for \\nits success.”\\nTanaji’s Plan : With these words \\nTanaji took charge of the campaign and left \\nfor Kondana. The fort was then under the \\nimmediate control of Udaybhan, a Rajput \\nofficer appointed by \\nJaising. Udaybhan \\nwas a disciplined \\nand vigilant \\nofficer. There \\nwere two \\nentrances \\n55to the fort. Both were heavily guarded by \\nUdaybhan’s men. How then to mount an assault ? Tanaji quietly made a detailed \\ninspection of the fort. On the western side \\nthere was a steep precipice where there were no guards. Tanaji decided to attack from that side. He explained his plan to \\nhis younger brother. He said, “You take a \\ndetachment of five hundred troops and try and reach the ‘Kalyan’ gate. With another three hundred I shall scale this precipice and get inside the fort. As soon as we are \\nthere, we shall throw open the doors of the \\n‘Kalyan’ gate. Then you step in and join us. Together we shall destroy the Moghul troops defending the fort.” With the plan thus finalised, Suryaji and Tanaji went \\ntheir different ways.\\nOver the Precipice and into the \\nFort   : It was a dark night. Tanaji and \\nhis men were gathered at the foot of the \\nprecipice. The sound of crickets could \\nbe heard all round. Five or six members \\nof Tanaji’s party started to scale the precipice. It was indeed very high and steep. But somehow they managed to get a \\nfoothold in the rock, pulled themselves up \\nby pushing their fingers into rock crevices and began the difficult and dangerous climb. Slowly but surely they reached the top. As soon as they were on safe ground, \\nthey tied a thick rope to a strong tree and \\nlet it down the precipice. The others took hold of the rope and climbed up to the top like monkeys.\\nTanaji’s Valour :  By now Suryaji \\nhad reached the Kalyan gate. He waited there for the doors to open. The battle on the fort started. Udaybhan heard of the attack. The battle drum was sounded. Udaybhan’s garrison attacked Tanaji’s men. A grim battle started between the two \\nforces in the light of dancing torches. The \\nMavlas opened the doors of the Kalyan gate. Tanaji was fighting like a brave lion. Udaybhan attacked him. Both were very brave and the battle between them \\nwas fierce. Tanaji’s shield was broken. \\nSo he tied his upper garment round his defending hand to parry Udaybhan’s blows and continued the fight. In the end \\nboth were mortally wounded and fell \\nfighting.\\nThe Fort is captured but the Lion \\nis dead : With the death of Tanaji the \\nMavlas found themselves without a leader and began to retreat. By then Suryaji and his men had arrived on the scene of battle. Suryaji was deeply grieved to know that his brother was dead. But he had no time \\nfor grief. He had to continue the fight. He \\ncut off the rope by which the Mavlas had climbed the fort. Then he stood in the path of the retreating Mavlas and said, “Don’t \\nyou see that your father is lying dead here \\non the battlefield ? Are you not ashamed to run away like a bunch of cowards\\n ? Turn \\nback and fight, for I have blocked your retreat by cutting off the rope by which \\nyou climbed up. The only choice before \\nyou is either to jump to your death over the precipice or to turn back and fight to destroy the enemy.”\\nSo the Mavlas returned to the fight \\nand attacked the enemy. A fierce battle raged. The Mavlas ultimately conquered \\n56the fort but in the process had lost their \\nbrave and lion-hearted leader, Tanaji. Jijamata and Shivaji Maharaj heard the news. They were struck with grief. Shivaji Maharaj expressed his sorrow in a single sentence : “The fort is won but the lion is dead.” So Kondana became Sinhagad, in \\nmemory of the great warrior who gave his life to recapture it. This event took place in 1670.

The new Kingdom was both \\nrespected and feared.\\nWith a view to having this kingdom \\nrecognized by all other princes in the land, big and small, Shivaji decided to \\nhave himself crowned. After hundreds of \\nyears, a king was born in Maharashtra \\nwho would treat all religions equally and \\ngive justice and happiness to his subjects. Shivaji decided to have himself crowned \\nso that everyone would come to know \\nthat Swaraj had been firmly established. \\nHe did not do it for self-glorification or \\npersonal happiness. He did it to give the newly founded Swaraj a firm footing.\\nThe Capital of Swaraj : Shivaji \\nselected Raigad as the capital of his \\nkingdom. Raigad was a strong hill fort \\nfrom where it was easy to administer the \\nkingdom and keep a watch on the enemy.\\nShivaji Raje inspected his troops \\nat Chiplun. He visited Pratapgad and \\ntook the goddess Bhavani’s ‘Darshan’. In grateful memory he presented to the \\ntemple a golden canopy for the goddess.15. A Memorable Ceremony\\nPreparations for the Coronation  : \\nThen Shivaji Raje ordered a golden \\nthrone to be made and had it studded \\nwith precious stones. He put a white royal \\numbrella over the throne. Invitations to \\nthe coronation were sent out to princes \\nand kings, learned Brahmins, all the Sardars under his command and other \\nofficers. Gagabhatt came from Varanasi \\nto act as the chief priest at the ceremony. \\nGagabhatt originally belonged to Paithan \\nbut had settled down in Varanasi. He was a great and renowned scholar respected in \\nVaranasi. \\nShivaji Maharaj made detailed \\npreparations for the coronation. Men were \\nsent out to bring waters of the seven rivers \\nand the sea. Nearly fifty thousand people \\ngathered at Raigad. Small tents, big tents, spacious shamianas to accommodate the \\nguests could be seen everywhere.\\nThe Coronation Ceremony :  The \\nCoronation Day dawned. It was indeed the \\nmost auspicious day. Musicians began to \\nplay on their instruments. Singers began to \\nsing, music and singing filled the air. There was an atmosphere of joy everywhere. \\nShivaji Raje sat on a golden seat in full \\nregalia. A canopy (chhatra) and the fans \\n(chamare) were held over his head. There \\nwere priests, each one carrying vessels of ghee, dahi and honey. Gagabhatt himself \\ncarried a gold vessel filled with the waters \\nof the seven rivers, Ganga, Sindhu, \\nYamuna, Godavari, Krishna, Narmada \\n58\\nThe Coronation Ceremony\\n59and Kaveri and of the sea. Gagabhatt \\nheld the vessel over Shivaji’s head and started reciting the coronation mantras. From a hundred tiny holes in the vessel, water started dripping down on Shivaji’s head. After ablution by the sacred waters Shivaji Maharaj got up and bowed before Jijamata and touched her feet. Jijamata held him in close embrace. Her eyes were filled with tears of joy. Her thirty years’ efforts had at last borne fruit. The dream she had nursed even before Shivaji’s birth had at last come true. The tears in her eyes were tears of joy and fulfilment. Shivaji Maharaj was also deeply moved. Glory be to both of them !\\nAfter meeting Maasaheb, Shivaji \\nMaharaj sat on the throne. Maharani Soyarabai and the Crown Prince Sambhaji  Raje sat next to him. His eight ministers stood on either side. Gagabhatt held the canopy lined with gold and pearl tassels \\nover his head and said, “Victory be to Shiva Chhatrapati, now crowned King, the ornament of the race of warriors.” Everyone present followed suit and in one voice wished victory to Shivaji Maharaj. Guns were fired from fort after fort. The whole of Maharashtra echoed with one voice, “Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai.” Shivaji’s coronation took place in 1674. From that year Shivaji Maharaj started a new calendar, the Coronation Calendar. He became a great king like those in whose name people start a new era. He struck his own coins. Some foreign envoys were present at the Coronation. The English had sent their envoy Oxinden with valuable presents. Subjects from far-off areas and places had also come to see this ceremony. The whole world came to know of the big event. Shivaji’s fame spread everywhere.\\n1.Fill in the blanks :\\n(a) Shivaji selected ...........  as the capital of \\nhis kingdom.\\n (Sinhagad, Raigad, Panhalgad)\\n(b) Shivaji’s coronation took place in  \\n........... . \\n(1674, 1675, 1647)\\n2.Write the answer in one sentence.\\n(a) The water of which seven rivers was\\nfilled in the golden vessel ?\\n(b) What Calendar did Shivaji Maharaj \\nstart from the year of his Coronation ?\\n3.

Campaign in the South\\nPlan of Campaign : The coronation \\nceremony was over but its joy was short-\\nlived. A short while after the coronation, on 17 June 1674, Maasaheb passed away. While all his subjects looked upon Shivaji Maharaj as their protector, Shivaji Maharaj himself depended upon the advice and help of Maasaheb. She was the true guide and Guru in his life. He was deeply grieved at the loss of his mother. But he had very little time for sorrow because he had to administer the kingdom which he had established.\\nHe decided to attack Karnatak. He \\nwas no longer afraid of Adilshah because the Kingdom of Bijapur was practically on its last legs. The real threat to Swaraj was from the North, for the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb was bidding his time to destroy the Maratha Kingdom. There was no knowing when he would attack and swallow the new kingdom. Shivaji thought that this campaign would create a powerful base in the South from where he could resist the blows of the Moghuls. With this in view, he planned his Southern campaign. He approached Kutubshah of Golconda for help and the Shah readily agreed to give whatever help was needed.\\nThere was yet another reason for \\nthe Campaign. Shivaji’s step-brother Vyankoji was looking after Shahaji Raje’s Tanjavur Jagir in the South. He would not give Shivaji his share of the \\nancestral Jagir. Neither did he display any love for Swaraj. He treated Shivaji with indifference. Shivaji thought that a personal meeting would resolve the dispute and Vyankoji could be persuaded to help in the work of Swaraj.\\nVisit to Golconda : Shivaji Maharaj \\nstarted on his Southern campaign. Abulhasan Kutubshah of Golconda had invited him to visit Golconda. He, therefore, decided to visit Golconda first and then proceed with his conquest of the South.\\nGolconda was the capital of \\nKutubshah’s Kingdom. He made great preparations to receive Shivaji. A special shamiana was put up where the two would meet. As Shivaji entered the capital, people lined the streets to have his ‘Darshan’. Stories of his exploits were the talk of the whole country. People had heard of the death of Afzalkhan at his hands, of the discomfiture of Shaistakhan and of Shivaji’s miraculous escape from Agra. Because of this, Shivaji Maharaj received a royal welcome. People showered flower petals on him from the house-tops. Acknowledging this wonderful reception, Shivaji entered Kutubshah’s darbar. Kutubshah came down half-way to receive him. He seated Shivaji Maharaj alongside himself as an equal on a specially prepared throne. He left nothing undone as far as reception was concerned.\\n61\\nThe Historic Visit of Shivaji Maharaj to Golconda\\nConquest of Jinji : Taking leave \\nof Kutubshah, Shivaji proceeded south \\nand reached the east coast. To the south \\nof Chennai is the fort of Jinji. It is a \\nbig fort, as big and strong as Raigad. Shivaji besieged and captured it. A strong Southern base was thus created for \\nSwaraj. Then he besieged the Vellore fort. \\nThe siege lasted for several months but the fort could not be conquered. Shivaji had to train his guns on the fort from a neighbouring hill before he could conquer \\nit. His southern campaign brought under \\nhis rule several forts and a territory with an annual revenue of twenty lakhs.Meeting with Vyankoji Raje :  \\nShivaji Maharaj invited Vyankoji Raje, his step-brother, to meet him. Vyankoji \\nRaje reluctantly agreed. Shivaji received \\nhim with great honour and tried to win him over. He appealed to Vyankoji Raje to help him in the work of Swaraj. \\nFor a few days, Vyankoji Raje stayed \\nwith Shivaji Maharaj but one night he returned to Tanjavur without even taking leave of Shivaji Maharaj. From Tanjavur he actually attacked Shivaji’s forces. \\nShivaji’s forces took heavy toll of the \\nattacking troops and Vyankoji Raje was defeated. Shivaji Maharaj was deeply \\n62pained at Vyankoji  Raje’s behaviour. He \\nwrote to him and tried to persuade him to change his ways. He conferred on him the territory south of Jinji and set aside a small part of Karnatak as a gift for Deepabai, Vyankoji’s wife. He said in his letter to Vyankoji Raje, ‘Do not put your trust in your enemies. Follow the path of valour.’\\nAfter the conclusion of this successful \\ncampaign of Karnatak Shivaji returned to Raigad. While he was yet to overcome the strain of this campaign, he had to undertake a naval campaign against the  Siddi of Janjira. At this time, Maharaj was \\nfifty years old. He had toiled continuously  for nearly thirty-five years, without any \\ntime to rest.\\nThe People’s Protector Is No More  : \\nOn 3rd April, 1680, Shivaji Maharaj died, \\nplunging his people into a sea of sorrow.

Let us look at a few \\nexamples :\\nBuilding Forts\\nShivaji Maharaj protected his Swaraj \\nwith the help of forts. In the book  \\n‘Aadnyaapatra’ or ‘Royal Edict ’, the \\nimportance of forts has been aptly \\nsummed up as follows : ‘The essence of \\nthe whole kingdom is forts’. Shivaji \\nMaharaj had roamed through the \\nSahyadri ranges in his youth. On  \\ncountless occasions, he had gazed at the \\nforts situated in the Sahyadri. He had \\nunderstood the importance of forts in the \\nprotection of Swaraj.\\nShivaji Maharaj built all three types \\nof forts - forest forts, hill forts and sea \\nforts. A sea fort is also known as  ‘Janjira’. He employed experts like Hiroji \\nIndulkar and Arjoji Yadav to build many \\nnew forts like Rajgad, Pratapgad and \\nSindhudurg. He repaired some old forts \\nlike Vijaydurg, Torana and Rangna and built the new fort of Raigad.

Management of Forts and the Navy\\n66Management of Forts\\nShivaji Maharaj had made definite \\narrangements for the protection of forts.\\nOn each fort, the officers Killedar, Sabnis and Karkhanis were appointed. \\nThe Sabnis and Karkhanis worked under the Killedar. Their work is shown in the chart below.\\nBuilding a Fort\\nKilledar (Havaldar)\\nSabnis Karkhanisl\\tTo protect and administer the fort.\\nl\\tTo issue orders to the Sabnis and Karkhanis.\\nl\\tTo follow government orders, instructions and letters.\\nl\\tTo keep accounts (Record income \\nand expenses on the fort).\\nl\\tTo collect revenue / tax from the subjects on the fort and around it.\\nl\\tTo handle the correspondence.l\\tSupply grains and goods to the people \\nliving on the fort.\\nl\\tTo arrange for the ammunition for the guns and firearms at the time of war.\\nl\\tTo look after and maintain the fort \\nand the buildings on it.\\n67\\nShivaji Maharaj inspecting the navyDiscuss :\\nl The guns on the fort were given \\na coating of wax.\\nCan you tell?\\nl  Name the types of the vessels in   \\n Shivaji Maharaj’s navy, for    \\n example, gurab, galbat, pal,   \\n machwa, nav, hodi (boat).\\n l Name the ships in the Navy  \\nof Independent India.   Guns and Ammunition\\nAt the time of Shivaji Maharaj, guns \\n(cannons) of various sizes were used to \\nprotect the forts from the enemy. The guns were placed on the bastions and fortifications of the fort. Some forts like Purandar and Bhimgad had provisions for making guns. Guns were made from metals like iron, brass, copper, etc. In  the rainy season, the guns were given      a wax-coating to prevent rusting. Iron    and stone cannonballs and canister    shots were fired at the enemy from the guns. To fire the shots, an explosive mixture was used.The Navy\\nA navy consists of warships. The \\nEnglish, the Portuguese, the Siddis and the \\nDutch had a strong naval force. Some of these people used to plunder the villages \\n68on the sea coast and torture the villagers. \\nShivaji Maharaj created an independent navy to permanently subdue these enemies on the sea.\\nShivaji Maharaj raised several \\ndockyards to build ships of various sizes. He gained control over old sea forts by \\nwinning them in battles. He repaired sea \\nforts like Suvarnadurg and Vijaydurg. He built a new sea fort called Sindhudurg on the Kurte island near Malvan. He also built the fort of Khanderi near Mumbai.\\nThe Swaraj navy included people \\nbelonging to various sea-faring communities like Koli, Bhandari, and Agari. Daulatkhan, Maynak Bhandari, Lai Patil,  Daryasarang, Tukoji Angre were some of the great men of his period, skilled in naval warfare.\\nBecause of the Maratha navy, the \\nEnglish, the Portuguese, the Siddis and \\nthe Dutch who were the enemies of the \\nMarathas began to fear and respect them. Their nuisance to Swaraj was reduced. By raising an independent and strong navy, Shivaji Maharaj defined his territorial waters and established domination over the coastal area. He \\nsafeguarded his sea-coast. This navy was \\nthe first of its kind in medieval India. That is why he is rightly regarded as the ‘Father of the Indian Navy’.\\nIntelligence Department : There \\nwas a well-organized and very efficient system of army intelligence and espionage. Bahirji Naik was the chief of \\nthis branch. The accurate information that he obtained helped greatly in making \\nthe campaigns like the Surat campaign \\nsuccessful. Shivaji’s spies found out \\ndetailed information about the enemy \\ncamp. Shivaji Maharaj started no offensive unless he had gathered \\ninformation from his spies. That is how \\nhe planned his campaigns.  \\nGuerilla Tactics : In the defence \\nstrategy of Shivaji Maharaj, guerilla \\ntactics were especially important. \\nGuerilla tactics include sudden and \\nunexpected attacks on the enemy at a \\nstrategic place and time. The guerilla army attacks the enemy, and without \\ngiving them time to recover, reaches a \\nsafe destination. Shivaji Maharaj was \\nhelped by the dense forests and hill forts \\nin the Sahyadris and the support of his \\nsubjects in this guerill a warfare.\\nDo you know?\\nl  Shivaji Maharaj had a disciplined \\narmy.

Management of the Welfare State of Swaraj\\nShivaji Maharaj struggled long \\nagainst many unjust powers. They were \\nthe Adilshahi and Moghul powers, the Portuguese, and the Siddis of Janjira. That is how an independent Hindavi Swaraj was created.\\nFor smooth working, Shivaji Maharaj \\ndivided the administration into eight departments. He appointed a Minister in \\ncharge of each. This was his famous \\ncouncil of eight ministers. The Swaraj of \\nShivaji Maharaj was a State run for the welfare of the people in the true sense of the term. It was run with the assistance of \\nthe eight ministers.

Read it aloud in the classroom.\\n\\t\\nProtection of Environment \\n‘Natural environment’ includes the \\nland in nature, as also factors like air, rain, rivers and streams, seas, forests, the birds and animals, light received from \\nthe sun, etc. It is beneficial for man to \\nmake use of this environment only to \\nmeet his necessities.  \\nShivaji Maharaj took precautions to \\navoid the destruction of these \\nenvironmental factors.Shivaji Maharaj saw to it that the \\nforests in his kingdom would not be destroyed by the people. From the ‘Royal Edict’, we can see that he had issued \\nmany orders like the following : For the \\nnavy, it is necessary to build boats and \\nships of various sizes and their beams, masts, oars, etc., for which wood is required. To obtain this wood, only teak trees should be cut. If more teakwood is required, it should be purchased from foreign territories. But on no account should mango, jackfruit or other trees be cut. They don’t grow in a year or two. People look after them like their own children in order to grow them. Cutting them is to inflict sorrow on the people. It should not be done. Even when a tree is greatly worn out, it should be cut only \\nafter paying the owner and getting  \\nhis consent.\\n72Water Management\\nShivaji Maharaj had various bunds \\nbuilt near the villages in Swaraj, to make \\ndrinking water available to the people. \\nCanals were dug out to make water \\navailable for agriculture. Due to this, \\nthere was an increase in the produce. \\nPeople in Swaraj never felt the severity of droughts. During the regime of Shivaji Always remember !\\n‘World Environment Day ’ is \\ncelebrated every year on 5th June, to \\nemphasize the importance of conserving \\nand protecting the environment.Protection of Environment\\nMaharaj, the number of people living on \\nforts was quite large. Shivaji Maharaj \\ntook care to make proper arrangements \\nfor water on the forts. Before building a \\nfort, the place was inspected to see \\nwhether enough water was available \\nthere. In case it didn’t have water, tanks \\nand reservoirs were built there, before the onset of the rainy season, and rainwater \\nwas stored in them.\\nThe stored water was used \\neconomically. Due to such water \\nmanagement, people on the forts and \\nother subjects in Swaraj did not suffer \\nfrom shortage of water even during drought periods.\\n\\n73\\nShivaji Maharaj made arrangements for drinking water and irrigation by constructing bunds and canals\\nCan you tell?\\nl  Why should we use water \\neconomically ?\\nl Name a dam or lake situated near \\nyour village or locality.\\nl What is water management?\\nl What are the government schemes \\nfor water management?\\nl  The Government has started the \\nproject ‘Jalyukt Shivar ’ to make     \\nMaharashtra a drought free State.Do you know?\\nDrought Relief\\nShivaji Maharaj gave various \\nfacilities to drought-affected peasants. \\nHe used to waive taxes. So the severity of drought was reduced for people in Swaraj. \\nIn a drought year, Shivaji Maharaj \\ndistributed the grain stored in the State \\ngranaries free of cost to the people. He \\nalso undertook repairs of various forts \\nand construction of dams, bunds and \\ncanals during drought years. This way, \\npeasants and artisans or balutedars could \\nearn their daily living and did not feel the \\nseverity of drought. \\nAs the peasant became wealthy, he \\ncould afford to buy things like footwear, \\nclothes, etc. This provided work to the \\nartisans. Those who were homeless till \\nthen, developed the capacity to build their own houses. This in turn provided \\nwork to the masons, the carpenters, the \\nblacksmiths, the brick-makers. This is \\nhow, along with the peasants in Swaraj, \\nartisans also become happy and wealthy.\\n74Sea Trade and other Markets\\nShivaji Maharaj raised his own \\nindependent Navy in order to protect his \\nSwaraj well and to establish his rule over \\nthe sea adjoining Swaraj. But that was \\nnot all. He also had special cargo ships built to promote trade in Swaraj. He \\ndeveloped trade ports like Rajapur. He \\nbuilt a special market on Raigad. He started a separate market place at Khed Shivapur near Pune. He developed \\nmarketplaces in big towns and roadside \\nvillages. A new ‘peth’ or settlement was established at Pashan near Pune by the \\norders of Veermata Jijabai. It was  \\nreferred to as ‘Jijapur’.\\nShivaji Maharaj levied more taxes \\non goods imported from the outside \\nregions to promote trade within Swaraj. \\nHe levied more tax on the salt produced \\nin the Portuguese territory, which made it \\ncostlier. On the other hand, he reduced the tax on the salt produced in Swaraj so \\nthat people could buy it at a cheaper rate. Naturally, it led to an increase in the trade of salt produced in Swaraj. Thus, \\nlocal trade was encouraged.\\nShivaji Maharaj made efforts for the \\ngrowth of trade and industries in Swaraj. \\nHe personally made sure that his subjects would not be cheated by the merchants in any way. When he came to know that people are being cheated in the coconut and betelnut trade in Konkan, he warned the Subhedar of that region.\\nHigh Regard for Women \\nShivaji Maharaj had ordered that the \\nwomen and children in the enemy camp \\nwere not to be harmed in any way during \\nthe period of war. In fact, they were to be treated with great respect. The behaviour of Shivaji Maharaj on several occasions, \\nset the ideal of how women were to be \\ntreated.\\nThe Maratha army had marched \\nupon Belawadi in Karnataka to vanquish \\nthe fortress there. Mallamma Desai, a brave woman, fought a great battle in defence of the fortress. When Shivaji Maharaj came to know about her courage, he called her his younger sister, returned her fortress and villages to her with honour and gave her the title ‘Savitri’. \\nVigilance Regarding Cleanliness\\nDuring the regime of  Shivaji \\nMaharaj, measures were taken to \\nmaintain better cleanliness in homes and in public places. He issued orders telling people to make a fence of the nirgudi bush around the house to prevent the entry of animals like mice, scorpions, insects and ants.  Fumigation was also suggested to destroy the germs that are harmful to health.\\nPeople were warned not to leave \\ngarbage lying on the roads and markets on the fort. If garbage piled up in various places in spite of all this, it was not to be \\nthrown down the fort. It was to be burnt \\non the spot and the ashes were to be used \\nas manure for vegetables grown in \\nbackyards.Can you tell?\\nl  Name the market in your village /  \\n locality.\\nl  How did the market acquire that     \\n name?     \\n75Shivaji Maharaj’s management of \\nforts, guns and firearms, his navy,  \\nprotection of the environment, water management, sea trade, markets, cleanliness and hygiene is a guiding force for us even today. \\nHindavi Swaraj\\nHindavi Swaraj was a dream of \\nShivaji Maharaj. Anyone who lived in \\nHindustan, no matter to what religion or community they belonged, was a ‘Hindavi’. Their raj was ‘Hindavi Swaraj’.\\nReligious Tolerance  \\nThe religious policy of Shivaji \\nMaharaj was liberal. In his campaigns, \\nhe never caused any harm to mosques. If he came across a copy of the Quran \\nShivaji Maharaj honours Mallamma Desai of Belawadi\\nSharif, he would respectfully pass it on to the Muslims. He never hated Muslims simply because they were Muslims. If a person who had changed his religion wished to return to his original religion, Shivaji always helped him. His brother-in-law, Bajaji Naik Nimbalkar, was in the service of Adilshah of Bijapur. Adilshah made him accept the Muslim faith. Bajaji made Bijapur his home. He lacked for nothing but he was unhappy that he had changed his religion. One day, he made up his mind to come back to his own religion. Shivaji Maharaj welcomed him back in his religion. The story of Netoji Palkar is similar. His religion had been changed but he wished to return to his original faith. Shivaji Maharaj accepted him back into his religion.\\n76Bring to memory, the wonderful image of Shivaji Maharaj ...l Shivaji Maharaj had great respect for \\nsaints and holy men. He honoured \\ntemples. He also gave protection to \\nmasjids. He respected both the Bhagavad \\nGeeta and the Quran Sharif. He gave \\nprotection to Christian churches also. He \\nhonoured learned men. Paramanand, \\nGagabhatt, Dhundiraj, Bhushan and \\nother learned men received his patronage. \\nHe bestowed great honour on Sant \\nTukaram, Samarth Ramdas, Baba Yakut \\nand Mauni Baba.Do you know?\\nRemember Him :   Shivaji was a \\ntorch-bearer in the dark night of slavery; \\na fighter who got the better of all difficult situations; who slowly but surely increased his strength while giving fight to powerful enemies; who encouraged his comrades and fooled his opponents and, in the end, achieved his goal. He was a model son, a cautious leader, a skilled organizer, a benevolent administrator, a clever military strategist, a great warrior, a terror to the wicked, a defender of the good, and an epoch maker. When one sees all these brilliant facets of his personality one cannot but say to oneself : \\n“Bring to memory his wonderful \\nimage and remember his great achievements.”\\n771.

The following passage elucidates his \\nattitude towards environment. \\n“For ships of the navy are necessary planks, \\nbeams, masts and such other limbs of wood. With \\nroyal permission useful parts of teak and other \\ntrees which are in the forests of the kingdom \\nshould be cut and collected. Besides this, \\nwhatever is necessary should be purchased and \\nbrought from foreign territories. Wood of mango \\ntree, jack tree, and other trees growing in one’s \\nown kingdom are useful for building naval ships \\nbut they should not be touched. For these trees are \\nnot grown in a year or two. People have grown \\nthese trees by looking after them as after their \\nchildren and by protecting them. If those trees \\nare cut there will be no limit to their grief. One \\nsays that would one achieve one’s object causing \\ngrief to another, then the temporary advantage \\nresulting to the doer of the work is ultimately lost \\ncompletely. Nay, the king incurs the sin causing \\ntrouble to the people. In the absence of these trees \\nthere is even loss. For these reasons these things \\nshould not be allowed to happen. Even when a tree is greatly worn out and is of no use, then by getting the consent of its owner and by paying \\nhim for it, it should be cut without displeasing \\nhim. Force should not at all be used.”\\n(The above translation by Prof. S.V.Puntambekar is taken from \\n‘AmkmnÌ’ Ed. Dr A. R. Kulkarni, Diamond Publications, 2007.)\\n79\\nThe fort of Jinji is currently in the State of Tamil Nadu. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj conquered \\nthis fort in his campaign of the South. This fort had always been strong and difficult to win. Even so \\nMaharaj demolished the earlier fortifications and made the fort stronger by building new fortifications   \\nand  watch towers. Shahaji Raje had trained him at a young age in making forts unassailable or \\ndifficult to win. It is seen that Shivaji Maharaj made use of that knowledge on this occasion. Later on, Rajaram Maharaj established his capital on this fort. The Moghuls beseiged the fort when he was there. But Rajaram Maharaj fought for nearly seven years defending the fort in a state of seige. He could stay safe in the fort for such a long period because Shivaji Maharaj had the foresight to make the fort even stronger.The Upper Fort at Fort Jinji\\nFort Rajgad\\n80Bhavanidevi - Pratapgad\\n\\n'"
